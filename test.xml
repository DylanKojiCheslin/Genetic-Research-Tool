<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Harvesting the full richness of biodiversity is instantly recognized by Diversa Corporation as a powerful means to access both novel molecules having direct commercial utility as well as molecular templates that could be retooled to acquire commercial utility. A directed evolution process for rapid and facilitated production from a progenitor polynucleotide template, of a library of mutagenized progeny polynucleotides wherein each of the 20 naturally encoded amino acids is encoded at each original codon position. This method, termed site-saturation mutagenesis, or simply saturation mutagenesis, is preferably based on the use of the degenerate N,N,G/T sequence. Also, a method of non-stochastically producing a library of chimeric nucleic acid molecules having an overall assembly order that is chosen by design. Accordingly, a set of progenitor templates, such as genes (e.g. a family of esterase genes) or genes pathways (e.g. encoding antibiotics) can be shuffled to generate a sizable library of distinct progeny polynucleotide molecules (e.g. 10<sup>100</sup>) and correspondingly encoded polypeptides. Screening of these polynucleotide libraries enables the identification of a desirable molecular species that has a desirable property, such as a specific enzymatic activity serviceable for a commercial application, or a novel antibiotic. Also, a method of retooling genes and gene pathways by the introduction of regulatory sequences, such as promoters, that are operable in an intended host, thus conferring operability to a novel gene pathway when it is introduced into an intended host. For example a novel man-made gene pathway, generated based on microbially-derived progenitor templates, that is operable in a plant cell.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to the field of protein engineering. Specifically, this invention relates to a directed evolution method for preparing a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide. More specifically, this invention relates to a method of using mutagenesis to generate a novel polynucleotide encoding a novel polypeptide, which novel polypeptide is itself an improved biological molecule &#x26;/or contributes to the generation of another improved biological molecule. More specifically still, this invention relates to a method of performing both non-stochastic polynucleotide chimerization and non-stochastic site-directed point mutagenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thus, in one aspect, this invention relates to a method of generating a progeny set of chimeric polynucleotide(s) by means that are synthetic and non-stochastic, and where the design of the progeny polynucleotide(s) is derived by analysis of a parental set of polynucleotides &#x26;/or of the polypeptides correspondingly encoded by the parental polynucleotides. In another aspect this invention relates to a method of performing site-directed mutagenesis using means that are exhaustive, systematic, and non-stochastic.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore this invention relates to a step of selecting from among a generated set of progeny molecules a subset comprised of particularly desirable species, including by a process termed end-selection, which subset may then be screened further. This invention also relates to the step of screening a set of polynucleotides for the production of a polypeptide &#x26;/or of another expressed biological molecule having a useful property.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Novel biological molecules whose manufacture is taught by this invention include genes, gene pathways, and any molecules whose expression is affected thereby, including directly encoded polypetides &#x26;/or any molecules affected by such polypeptides. Said novel biological molecules include those that contain a carbohydrate, a lipid, a nucleic acid, &#x26;/or a protein component, and specific but non-limiting examples of these include antibiotics, antibodies, enzymes, and steroidal and non-steroidal hormones.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a particular non-limiting aspect, the present invention relates to enzymes, particularly to thermostable enzymes, and to their generation by directed evolution. More particularly, the present invention relates to thermostable enzymes which are stable at high temperatures and which have improved activity at lower temperatures.</p>

<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Brief Summary: It is instantly appreciated that harvesting the full potential of nature's diversity can include both the step of discovery and the step of optimizing what is discovered. For example, the step of discovery allows one to mine biological molecules that have commercial utility. It is instantly appreciated that the ability to harvest the full richness of biodiversity, i.e. to mine biological molecules from a wide range of environmental conditions, is critical to the ability to discover novel molecules adapted to <?delete-start id="REI-00003"  date="20150120" ?>funtion<?delete-end id="REI-00003" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00004"  date="20150120" ?>function <?insert-end id="REI-00004" ?>under a wide variety of conditions, including extremes of conditions, such as may be found in a commercial application.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, it is also instantly appreciated that only <?delete-start id="REI-00005"  date="20150120" ?>occassionally<?delete-end id="REI-00005" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00006"  date="20150120" ?>occasionally <?insert-end id="REI-00006" ?>are there criteria for selection &#x26;/or survival in nature that point in the exact direction of particular commercial needs. Instead, it is often the case that a naturally occurring molecule will require a certain amount of change&#x2014;from fine tuning to sweeping modification&#x2014;in order to fulfill a particular unmet commercial need. Thus, to meet certain commercial needs (e.g., a need for a molecule that is functional under a specific set of commercial processing conditions) it is sometimes advantageous to experimentally modify a naturally <?delete-start id="REI-00007"  date="20150120" ?>expresed<?delete-end id="REI-00007" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00008"  date="20150120" ?>expressed <?insert-end id="REI-00008" ?>molecule to achieve properties beyond what natural evolution has provided &#x26;/or is likely to provide in the near future.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The approach, termed directed evolution, of experimentally modifying a biological molecule towards a desirable property, can be achieved by mutagenizing one or more parental molecular templates and by identifying any desirable molecules among the progeny molecules. Currently available technologies in directed evolution include methods for achieving stochastic (i.e. random) mutagenesis and methods for achieving non-stochastic (non-random) mutagenesis. However, critical shortfalls in both types of methods are identified in the instant disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In prelude, it is noteworthy that it may be argued philosophically by some that all mutagenesis&#x2014;if considered from an objective point of view&#x2014;is non-stochastic; and furthermore that the entire universe is undergoing a process that&#x2014;if considered from an objective point of view&#x2014;is non-stochastic. Whether this is true is outside of the scope of the instant consideration. Accordingly, as used herein, the terms &#x201c;randomness&#x201d;, &#x201c;uncertainty&#x201d;, and &#x201c;unpredictability&#x201d; have subjective meanings, and the knowledge, particularly the predictive knowledge, of the designer of an experimental process is a determinant of whether the process is stochastic or non-stochastic.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">By way of illustration, stochastic or random mutagenesis is exemplified by a situation in which a progenitor molecular template is mutated (modified or changed) to yield a set of progeny molecules having mutation(s) that are not predetermined. Thus, in an in vitro stochastic mutagenesis reaction, for example, there is not a particular predetermined product whose production is intended; rather there is an uncertainty&#x2014;hence randomness&#x2014;regarding the exact nature of the mutations achieved, and thus also regarding the products generated. In contrast, non-stochastic or non-random mutagenesis is exemplified by a situation in which a progenitor molecular template is mutated (modified or changed) to yield a progeny molecule having one or more predetermined mutations. It is appreciated that the presence of background products in some quantity is a reality in many reactions where molecular processing occurs, and the presence of these background products does not detract from the non-stochastic nature of a mutagenesis process having a predetermined product.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, as used herein, stochastic mutagenesis is manifested in processes such as error-prone PCR and stochastic shuffling, where the mutation(s) achieved are random or not predetermined. In contrast, as used herein, non-stochastic mutagenesis is manifested in the instantly disclosed processes such as gene site-saturation mutagenesis and synthetic ligation reassembly, where the exact chemical structure(s) of the intended product(s) are predetermined.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In brief, existing mutagenesis methods that are non-stochastic have been serviceable in generating from one to only a very small number of predetermined mutations per method application, and thus produce per method application from one to only a few progeny molecules that have predetermined molecular structures. Moreover, the types of mutations currently available by the application of these non-stochastic methods are also limited, and thus so are the types of progeny mutant molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In contrast, existing methods for mutagenesis that are stochastic in nature have been serviceable for generating somewhat larger numbers of mutations per method application&#x2014;though in a random fashion &#x26; usually with a large but unavoidable contingency of undesirable background products. Thus, these existing stochastic methods can produce per method application larger numbers of progeny molecules, but that have undetermined molecular structures. The types of mutations that can be achieved by application of these current stochastic methods are also limited, and thus so are the types of progeny mutant molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is instantly appreciated that there is a need for the development of non-stochastic mutagenesis methods that:

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0022">The instant invention satisfies all of these needs.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0023">Directed Evolution Supplements Natural Evolution: Natural evolution has been a springboard for directed or experimental evolution, serving both as a reservoir of methods to be mimicked and of molecular templates to be mutagenized. It is appreciated that, despite its intrinsic process-related limitations (in the types of favored &#x26;/or allowed mutagenesis processes) and in its speed, natural evolution has had the advantage of having been in process for millions of years and throughout a wide diversity of environments. Accordingly, natural evolution (molecular mutagenesis and selection in nature) has resulted in the generation of a wealth of biological compounds that have shown usefulness in certain commercial applications.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0024">However, it is instantly appreciated that many unmet commercial needs are discordant with any evolutionary pressure &#x26;/or direction that can be found in nature. Moreover, it is often the case that when commercially useful mutations would otherwise be favored at the molecular level in nature, natural evolution often overrides the positive selection of such mutations, e.g. when there is a concurrent detriment to an organism as a whole (such as when a favorable mutation is accompanied by a detrimental mutation). Additionally, natural evolution is often slow, and favors fidelity in many types of replication. Additionally still, natural evolution often favors a path paved mainly by consecutive beneficial mutations while tending to avoid a plurality of successive negative mutations, even though such negative mutations may prove beneficial when combined, or may lead&#x2014;through a circuitous route&#x2014;to final state that is beneficial.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0025">Moreover, natural evolution advances through specific steps (e.g. specific mutagenesis and selection processes), with avoidance of less favored steps. For example, many nucleic acids do not reach close enough proximity to each other in a operative environment to undergo chimerization or incorporation or other types of transfers from one species to another. Thus, e.g., when sexual intercourse between 2 particular species is avoided in nature, the chimerization of nucleic acids from these 2 species is likewise unlikely, with parasites common to the two species serving as an example of a very slow passageway for inter-molecular encounters and exchanges of DNA. For another example, the generation of a molecule causing self-toxicity or self-lethality or sexual sterility is avoided in nature. For yet another example, the propagation of a molecule having no particular immediate benefit to an organism is prone to vanish in subsequent generations of the organism. Furthermore, e.g., there is no selection pressure for improving the performance of molecule under conditions other than those to which it is exposed in its endogenous environment; e.g. a cytoplasmic molecule is not likely to acquire functional features extending beyond what is required of it in the cytoplasm. Furthermore still, the propagation of a biological molecule is susceptible to any global detrimental effects&#x2014;whether caused by itself or not&#x2014;on its ecosystem. These and other characteristics greatly limit the types of mutations that can be propagated in nature.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0026">On the other hand, directed (or experimental) evolution&#x2014;particularly as provided herein&#x2014;can be performed much more rapidly and can be directed in a more streamlined manner at evolving a predetermined molecular property that is commercially desirable where nature does not provide one &#x26;/or is not likely to provide. Moreover, the directed evolution invention provided herein can provide more wide-ranging possibilities in the types of steps that can be used in mutagenesis and selection processes. Accordingly, using templates harvested from nature, the instant directed evolution invention provides more wide-ranging possibilities in the types of progeny molecules that can be generated and in the speed at which they can be generated than often nature itself might be expected to in the same length of time.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0027">In a particular exemplification, the instantly disclosed directed evolution methods can be applied iteratively to produce a lineage of progeny molecules (e.g. comprising successive sets of progeny molecules) that would not likely be propagated (i.e., generated &#x26;/or selected for) in nature, but that could lead to the generation of a desirable downstream mutagenesis product that is not achievable by natural evolution.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0028">Previous Directed Evolution Methods Are Suboptimal:</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0029">Mutagenesis has been attempted in the past on many occasions, but by methods that are inadequate for the purpose of this invention. For example, previously described non-stochastic methods have been serviceable in the generation of only very small sets of progeny molecules (comprised often of merely a solitary progeny molecule). By way of illustration, a chimeric gene has been made by joining 2 polynucleotide fragments using compatible sticky ends generated by restriction enzyme(s), where each fragment is derived from a separate progenitor (or parental) molecule. Another example might be the mutagenesis of a single codon position (i.e. to achieve a codon substitution, addition, or deletion) in a parental polynucleotide to generate a single progeny polynucleotide encoding for a single site-mutagenized polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0030">Previous non-stochastic approaches have only been serviceable in the generation of but one to a few mutations per method application. Thus, these previously described non-stochastic methods thus fail to address one of the central goals of this invention, namely the exhaustive and non-stochastic chimerization of nucleic acids. Accordingly previous non-stochastic methods leave untapped the vast majority of the possible point mutations, chimerizations, and combinations thereof, which may lead to the generation of highly desirable progeny molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0031">In contrast, stochastic methods have been used to achieve larger numbers of point mutations and/or chimerizations than non-stochastic methods; for this reason, stochastic methods have comprised the predominant approach for generating a set of progeny molecules that can be subjected to screening, and amongst which a desirable molecular species might hopefully be found. However, a major drawback of these approaches is that&#x2014;because of their stochastic nature&#x2014;there is a randomness to the exact components in each set of progeny molecules that is produced. Accordingly, the experimentalist typically has little or no idea what exact progeny molecular species are represented in a particular reaction vessel prior to their generation. Thus, when a stochastic procedure is repeated (e.g. in a continuation of a search for a desirable progeny molecule), the re-generation and re-screening of previously discarded undesirable molecular species becomes a labor-intensive obstruction to progress, causing a circuitous&#x2014;if not circular&#x2014;path to be taken. The drawbacks of such a highly suboptimal path can be addressed by subjecting a stochastically generated set of progeny molecules to a labor-incurring process, such as sequencing, in order to identify their molecular structures, but even this is an incomplete remedy.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0032">Moreover, current stochastic approaches are highly unsuitable for comprehensively or exhaustively generating all the molecular species within a particular grouping of mutations, for attributing functionality to specific structural groups in a template molecule (e.g. a specific single amino acid position or a sequence comprised of two or more amino acids positions), and for categorizing and comparing specific grouping of mutations. Accordingly, current stochastic approaches do not inherently enable the systematic elimination of unwanted mutagenesis results, and are, in sum, burdened by too many inherently shortcomings to be optimal for directed evolution.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0033">In a non-limiting aspect, the instant invention addresses these problems by providing non-stochastic means for comprehensively and exhaustively generating all possible point mutations in a parental template. In another non-limiting aspect, the instant invention further provides means for exhaustively generating all possible chimerizations within a group of chimerizations. Thus, the aforementioned problems are solved by the instant invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0034">Specific shortfalls in the technological landscape addressed by this invention include:

    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0035">1) Site-directed mutagenesis technologies, such as sloppy or low-fidelity PCR, are ineffective for systematically achieving at each position (site) along a polypeptide sequence the full (saturated) range of possible mutations (i.e. all possible amino acid substitutions).</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0036">2) There is no relatively easy systematic means for rapidly analyzing the large amount of information that can be contained in a molecular sequence and in the potentially colossal number or progeny molecules that could be conceivably obtained by the directed evolution of one or more molecular templates.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0037">3) There is no relatively easy systematic means for providing comprehensive empirical information relating structure to function for molecular positions.</li>

        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0039">5) There is no easy systematic means to select for a specific group of progeny molecules, such as full-length chimeras, from among smaller partial sequences.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0040">An exceedingly large number of possibilities exist for the purposeful and random combination of amino acids within a protein to produce useful hybrid proteins and their corresponding biological molecules encoding for these hybrid proteins, i.e., DNA, RNA. Accordingly, there is a need to produce and screen a wide variety of such hybrid proteins for a desirable utility, particularly widely varying random proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0041">The complexity of an active sequence of a biological macromolecule (e.g., polynucleotides, polypeptides, and molecules that are comprised of both polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences) has been called its information content (&#x201c;IC&#x201d;), which has been defined as the resistance of the active protein to amino acid sequence variation (calculated from the minimum number of invariable amino acids (bits) required to describe a family of related sequences with the same function). Proteins that are more sensitive to random mutagenesis have a high information content.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0042">Molecular biology developments, such as molecular libraries, have allowed the identification of quite a large number of variable bases, and even provide ways to select functional sequences from random libraries. In such libraries, most residues can be varied (although typically not all at the same time) depending on compensating changes in the context. Thus, while a 100 amino acid protein can contain only 2,000 different mutations, 20<sup>100 </sup>sequence combinations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0043">Information density is the IC per unit length of a sequence. Active sites of enzymes tend to have a high information density. By contrast, flexible linkers of information in enzymes have a low information density.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0044">Current methods in widespread use for creating alternative proteins in a library format are error-prone polymerase chain reactions and cassette mutagenesis, in which the specific region to be optimized is replaced with a synthetically mutagenized oligonucleotide. In both cases, a substantial number of mutant sites are generated around certain sites in the original sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0045">Error-prone PCR uses low-fidelity polymerization conditions to introduce a low level of point mutations randomly over a long sequence. In a mixture of fragments of unknown sequence, error-prone PCR can be used to mutagenize the mixture. The published error-prone PCR protocols suffer from a low processivity of the polymerase. Therefore, the protocol is unable to result in the random mutagenesis of an average-sized gene. This inability limits the practical application of error-prone PCR. Some computer simulations have suggested that point mutagenesis alone may often be too gradual to allow the large-scale block changes that are required for continued and dramatic sequence evolution. Further, the published error-prone PCR protocols do not allow for amplification of DNA fragments greater than 0.5 to 1.0 kb, limiting their practical application. In addition, repeated cycles of error-prone PCR can lead to an accumulation of neutral mutations with undesired results, such as affecting a protein's immunogenicity but not its binding affinity.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0046">In oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, a short sequence is replaced with a synthetically mutagenized oligonucleotide. This approach does not generate combinations of distant mutations and is thus not combinatorial. The limited library size relative to the vast sequence length means that many rounds of selection are unavoidable for protein optimization. Mutagenesis with synthetic oligonucleotides requires sequencing of individual clones after each selection round followed by grouping them into families, arbitrarily choosing a single family, and reducing it to a consensus motif. Such motif is re-synthesized and reinserted into a single gene followed by additional selection. This step process constitutes a statistical bottleneck, is labor intensive, and is not practical for many rounds of mutagenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0047">Error-prone PCR and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis are thus useful for single cycles of sequence fine tuning, but rapidly become too limiting when they are applied for multiple cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0048">Another limitation of error-prone PCR is that the rate of down-mutations grows with the information content of the sequence. As the information content, library size, and mutagenesis rate increase, the balance of down-mutations to up-mutations will statistically prevent the selection of further improvements (statistical ceiling).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0049">In cassette mutagenesis, a sequence block of a single template is typically replaced by a (partially) randomized sequence. Therefore, the maximum information content that can be obtained is statistically limited by the number of random sequences (i.e., library size). This eliminates other sequence families which are not currently best, but which may have greater long term potential.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0050">Also, mutagenesis with synthetic oligonucleotides requires sequencing of individual clones after each selection round. Thus, such an approach is tedious and impractical for many rounds of mutagenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0051">Thus, error-prone PCR and cassette mutagenesis are best suited, and have been widely used, for fine-tuning areas of comparatively low information content. One apparent exception is the selection of an RNA ligase ribozyme from a random library using many rounds of amplification by error-prone PCR and selection.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0052">In nature, the evolution of most organisms occurs by natural selection and sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction ensures mixing and combining of the genes in the offspring of the selected individuals. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes from the parents line up with one another and cross-over part way along their length, thus randomly swapping genetic material. Such swapping or shuffling of the DNA allows organisms to evolve more rapidly.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0053">In recombination, because the inserted sequences were of proven utility in a homologous environment, the inserted sequences are likely to still have substantial information content once they are inserted into the new sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0054">Theoretically there are 2,000 different single mutants of a 100 amino acid protein. However, a protein of 100 amino acids has 20<sup>100 </sup>possible sequence combinations, a number which is too large to exhaustively explore by conventional methods. It would be advantageous to develop a system which would allow generation and screening of all of these possible combination mutations.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0055">Some workers in the art have utilized an in vivo site specific recombination system to generate hybrids of combine light chain antibody genes with heavy chain antibody genes for expression in a phage system. However, their system relies on specific sites of recombination and is limited accordingly. Simultaneous mutagenesis of antibody CDR regions in single chain antibodies (scFv) by overlapping extension and PCR have been reported.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0056">Others have described a method for generating a large population of multiple hybrids using random in vivo recombination. This method requires the recombination of two different libraries of plasmids, each library having a different selectable marker. The method is limited to a finite number of recombinations equal to the number of selectable markers existing, and produces a concomitant linear increase in the number of marker genes linked to the selected sequence(s).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0057">In vivo recombination between two homologous, but truncated, insect-toxin genes on a plasmid has been reported as a method of producing a hybrid gene. The in vivo recombination of substantially mismatched DNA sequences in a host cell having defective mismatch repair enzymes, resulting in hybrid molecule formation has been reported.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0058">This invention relates generally to the field of nucleic acid engineering and correspondingly encoded recombinant protein engineering. More particularly, the invention relates to the directed evolution of nucleic acids and screening of clones containing the evolved nucleic acids for resultant activity(ies) of interest, such nucleic acid activity(ies) &#x26;/or specified protein, particularly enzyme, activity(ies) of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0059">Mutagenized molecules provided by this invention may have chimeric molecules and molecules with point mutations, including biological molecules that contain a carbohydrate, a lipid, a nucleic acid, &#x26;/or a protein component, and specific but non-limiting examples of these include antibiotics, antibodies, enzymes, and steroidal and non-steroidal hormones.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0060">This invention relates generally to a method of: 1) preparing a progeny generation of molecule(s) (including a molecule that is comprised of a polynucleotide sequence, a molecule that is comprised of a polypeptide sequence, and a molecule that is comprised in part of a polynucleotide sequence and in part of a polypeptide sequence), that is mutagenized to achieve at least one point mutation, addition, deletion, &#x26;/or chimerization, from one or more ancestral or parental generation template(s); 2) screening the progeny generation molecule(s)&#x2014;preferably using a high throughput method&#x2014;for at least one property of interest (such as an improvement in an enzyme activity or an increase in stability or a novel chemotherapeutic effect); 3) optionally obtaining &#x26;/or cataloguing structural &#x26;/or and functional information regarding the parental &#x26;/or progeny generation molecules; and 4) optionally repeating any of steps 1) to 3).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0061">In a preferred embodiment, there is generated (e.g. from a parent polynucleotide template)&#x2014;in what is termed &#x201c;codon site-saturation mutagenesis&#x201d;&#x2014;a progeny generation of polynucleotides, each having at least one set of up to three contiguous point mutations (i.e. different bases comprising a new codon), such that every codon (or every family of degenerate codons encoding the same amino acid) is represented at each codon position. Corresponding to&#x2014;and encoded by&#x2014;this progeny generation of polynucleotides, there is also generated a set of progeny polypeptides, each having at least one single amino acid point mutation. In a preferred aspect, there is generated&#x2014;in what is termed &#x201c;amino acid site-saturation mutagenesis&#x201d;&#x2014;one such mutant polypeptide for each of the 19 naturally encoded polypeptide-forming alpha-amino acid substitutions at each and every amino acid position along the polypeptide. This yields&#x2014;for each and every amino acid position along the parental polypeptide&#x2014;a total of 20 distinct progeny polypeptides including the original amino acid, or potentially more than 21 distinct progeny polypeptides if additional amino acids are used either instead of or in addition to the 20 naturally encoded amino acids</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0062">Thus, in another aspect, this approach is also serviceable for generating mutants containing&#x2014;in addition to &#x26;/or in combination with the 20 naturally encoded polypeptide-forming alpha-amino acids&#x2014;other rare &#x26;/or not naturally-encoded amino acids and amino acid derivatives. In yet another aspect, this approach is also serviceable for generating mutants by the use of&#x2014;in addition to &#x26;/or in combination with natural or unaltered codon recognition systems of suitable hosts&#x2014;altered, mutagenized, &#x26;/or designer codon recognition systems (such as in a host cell with one or more altered tRNA molecules).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0063">In yet another aspect, this invention relates to recombination and more specifically to a method for preparing polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide by a method of in vivo re-assortment of polynucleotide sequences containing regions of partial homology, assembling the polynucleotides to form at least one polynucleotide and screening the polynucleotides for the production of polypeptide(s) having a useful property.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0064">In yet another preferred embodiment, this invention is serviceable for analyzing and cataloguing&#x2014;with respect to any molecular property (e.g. an enzymatic activity) or combination of properties allowed by current technology&#x2014;the effects of any mutational change achieved (including particularly saturation mutagenesis). Thus, a comprehensive method is provided for determining the effect of changing each amino acid in a parental polypeptide into each of at least 19 possible substitutions. This allows each amino acid in a parental polypeptide to be characterized and catalogued according to its spectrum of potential effects on a measurable property of the polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0065">In another aspect, the method of the present invention utilizes the natural property of cells to recombine molecules and/or to mediate reductive processes that reduce the complexity of sequences and extent of repeated or consecutive sequences possessing regions of homology.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0066">It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for generating hybrid polynucleotides encoding biologically active hybrid polypeptides with enhanced activities. In accomplishing these and other objects, there has been provided, in accordance with one aspect of the invention, a method for introducing polynucleotides into a suitable host cell and growing the host cell under conditions that produce a hybrid polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0067">In another aspect of the invention, the invention provides a method for screening for biologically active hybrid polypeptides encoded by hybrid polynucleotides. The present method allows for the identification of biologically active hybrid polypeptides with enhanced biological activities.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0068">According to another aspect of this invention is provided that an important advantage of the synthetic ligation reassembly methods provided herein is that the starting templates that can be aligned and subjected to ligation reassembly are not limited to full length genes. In fact when working with genomic sequences it is often the case that partial gene sequences are obtained, and these can be subjected to ligation reassembly according to this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0069">In an important aspect of this invention, it is appreciated herein that nucleic acid building blocks that are serviceable for this invention can be generated by synthetic means or alternatively by polymerase-based methods either in vivo or in vitro or alternatively by a combination of synthetic means and polymerase-based means. The likelihood of nucleotide incorporation errors is different for each method. Among such errors some may be undesirable at times. For example the presence of a single nucleotide mistake in the generation of up a nucleic acid building block can lead to the undesirable introduction of a stop codon. It is appreciated that several prescreening methods can be used to filter out to undesirable nucleotide incorporation errors. For example the finalized construct can be a fusion product that includes a reporter sequence, such as GFP or a 6&#xd7;His tag <?insert-start id="REI-00009"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 23)<?insert-end id="REI-00009" ?>, that is only generated in the absence of unwanted internal stop codons. It is also appreciated that the selection all of the method by which nucleic acid building blocks are generated can be based upon consideration of the error rates of each method considered.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0070">Furthermore, it is provided that, according to this invention, nucleic acid building blocks may be single-stranded or double-stranded polynucleotides. Thus, ligation reassembly according to this invention may be performed using synthetic as well as non-synthetic nucleic acid building blocks up, or a combination thereof.

<p id="p-0065" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Exonuclease Activity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the activity of the enzyme exonuclease III. This is an exemplary enzyme that can be used to shuffle, assemble, reassemble, recombine, and/or concatenate polynucleotide building blocks. The asterisk indicates that the enzyme acts from the 3&#x2032; direction towards the 5&#x2032; direction of the polynucleotide substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Generation of A Nucleic Acid Building Block by Polymerase-Based Amplification. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a method of generating a double-stranded nucleic acid building block with two overhangs using a polymerase-based amplification reaction (e.g., PCR). As illustrated, a first polymerase-based amplification reaction using a first set of primers, F<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>1</sub>, is used to generate a blunt-ended product (labeled Reaction 1, Product 1), which is essentially identical to Product A. A second polymerase-based amplification reaction using a second set of primers, F<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2</sub>, is used to generate a blunt-ended product (labeled Reaction 2, Product 2), which is essentially identical to Product B. These two products are then mixed and allowed to melt and anneal, generating a potentially useful double-stranded nucleic acid building block with two overhangs. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the product with the 3&#x2032; overhangs (Product C) is selected for by nuclease-based degradation of the other 3 products using a 3&#x2032; acting exonuclease, such as exonuclease III. Alternate primers are shown in parenthesis to illustrate serviceable primers may overlap, and additionally that serviceable primers may be of different lengths, as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Unique Overhangs And Unique Couplings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the point that the number of unique overhangs of each size (e.g. the total number of unique overhangs composed of 1 or 2 or 3, etc. nucleotides) exceeds the number of unique couplings that can result from the use of all the unique overhangs of that size. For example, there are 4 unique 3&#x2032; overhangs composed of a single nucleotide, and 4 unique 5&#x2032; overhangs composed of a single nucleotide. Yet the total number of unique couplings that can be made using all the 8 unique single-nucleotide 3&#x2032; overhangs and single-nucleotide 5&#x2032; overhangs is 4, as presented in Panel A. Panel B shows that the number of unique single-nucleotide 3&#x2032; overhangs is greater than the number of unique couplings. Thus, only 2 intrinsically unique couplings exist using single-nucleotide 3&#x2032; overhangs as shown, Panel C shows 4 unique-single nucleotide 5&#x2032; overhangs are possible (i.e. A, C, G, &#x26; T). For each of these there is a complementary 5&#x2032; overhang with which it can pair (i.e., T, G, C, &#x26; A, respectively), as shown. Panel D shows that the number of unique single-nucleotide 5&#x2032; overhangs is greater than the number of unique couplings. Thus, only 2 intrinsically unique couplings exist using single-nucleotide 5&#x2032; overhangs as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. Unique Overall Assembly Order Achieved by Sequentially Coupling the Building Blocks. Awareness of the degeneracy (between the number of unique overhangs and the number of unique couplings) is important in order to avoid the production of degeneracy in the overall assembly order of the finalized nucleic acid. However, a unique overall assembly order can also be achieved&#x2014;despite the use of non-unique couplings&#x2014;by using building blocks having distinct combinations of couplings, and/or by stepping the assembly of the building blocks in a deliberately chosen sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0079">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, Panel A, for example, one could attempt to assemble the following nucleic acid product using the 5 nucleic acid building blocks as shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates the fact that in order to assemble a total of &#x201c;n&#x201d; nucleic acid building blocks, &#x201c;n&#x2212;1&#x201d; couplings are needed. Yet it is sometimes the case that the number of unique couplings available for use is fewer that the &#x201c;n&#x2212;1&#x201d; value. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, Panel B, degeneracy in the overall assembly order of the 5 nucleic acid building blocks would be present if the assembly process were carried out in one step. For example, building block #2 and building block #3 could both couple to building block #1 as shown. Under these, and other, circumstances a stringent non-stochastic overall assembly order can still be achieved by performing the assembly process in sequential steps.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0080">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates a unique overall assembly order could be achieved by sequentially coupling the building blocks in 2 steps (rather than all at once) as shown. In this example, 2 sequential steps are used to achieve a designed overall assembly order for five nucleic acid building blocks. In this illustration the designed overall assembly order for the five nucleic acid building blocks is: 5&#x2032;-(#1-#2-#3-#4-#5)-3&#x2032;, where #1 represents building block number 1, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Unique Couplings Available Using a Two-Nucleotide 3&#x2032; Overhang. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> further illustrates the point that the number of unique overhangs of each size (here, e.g. the total number of unique overhangs composed of 2 nucleotides) exceeds the number of unique couplings that can result from the use of all the unique overhangs of that size. For example, there are 16 unique 3&#x2032; overhangs composed of two nucleotides, and another 16 unique 5&#x2032; overhangs composed of two nucleotides, for a total of 32 as shown. Yet the total number of couplings that are unique and not self-binding that can be made using all the 32 unique double-nucleotide 3&#x2032; overhangs and double-nucleotide 5&#x2032; overhangs is 12. Some apparently unique couplings have &#x201c;identical twins&#x201d; (marked in the same shading), which are visually obvious in this illustration. Still other overhangs contain nucleotide sequences that can self-bind in a palindromic fashion, as shown and labeled in this figure; thus they do not contribute the high stringency to the overall assembly order.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <?insert-start id="REI-00010"  date="20150120" ?>A, B, and C<?insert-end id="REI-00010" ?>. Generation of an Exhaustive Set of Chimeric Combinations by Synthetic Ligation Reassembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> showcases the power of this invention in its ability to generate exhaustively and systematically all possible combinations of the nucleic acid building blocks designed in this example. Particularly large sets (or libraries) of progeny chimeric molecules can be generated. Because this method can be performed exhaustively and systematically, the method application can be repeated by choosing new demarcation points and with correspondingly newly designed nucleic acid building blocks, bypassing the burden of re-generating and re-screening previously examined and rejected molecular species. It is appreciated that, codon wobble can be used to advantage to increase the frequency of a demarcation point. In other words, a particular base can often be substituted into a nucleic acid building block without altering the amino acid encoded by progenitor codon (that is now altered codon) because of codon degeneracy. As illustrated, demarcation points are chosen upon alignment of 8 progenitor templates <?insert-start id="REI-00011"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NOS 1-8: consensus sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9)<?insert-end id="REI-00011" ?>. Nucleic acid building blocks including their overhangs (which are serviceable for the formation of ordered couplings) are then designed and synthesized. In this instance, 18 nucleic acid building blocks are generated based on the sequence of each of the 8 progenitor templates, for a total of 144 nucleic acid building blocks (or double-stranded oligos). Performing the ligation synthesis procedure will then produce a library of progeny molecules comprised of yield of 8<sup>18 </sup>(or over 1.8&#xd7;10<sup>16</sup>) chimeras.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> <?insert-start id="REI-00012"  date="20150120" ?>A, B, C, and D<?insert-end id="REI-00012" ?>. Synthetic genes from oligos: According to one embodiment of this invention, double-stranded nucleic acid building blocks are designed by aligning a plurality of progenitor nucleic acid templates. Preferably these templates contain some homology and some heterology. The nucleic acids may encode related proteins, such as related enzymes, which relationship may be based on function or structure or both. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the alignment of three polynucleotide progenitor templates <?insert-start id="REI-00013"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NOS 10-12, respectively, in order of appearance) <?insert-end id="REI-00013" ?>and the selection of demarcation points (boxed) shared by all the progenitor molecules. In this particular example, the nucleic acid building blocks derived from each of the progenitor templates were chosen to be approximately 30 to 50 nucleotides in length.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Nucleic acid building blocks for synthetic ligation gene reassembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the nucleic acid building blocks from the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The nucleic acid building blocks are shown here in generic cartoon form, with their compatible overhangs, including both 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; overhangs. There are 22 total nucleic acid building blocks derived from each of the 3 progenitor templates. Thus, the ligation synthesis procedure can produce a library of progeny molecules comprised of yield of 3<sup>22 </sup>(or over 3.1&#xd7;10<sup>10</sup>) chimeras.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Addition of Introns by Synthetic Ligation Reassembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows in generic cartoon form that an intron may be introduced into a chimeric progeny molecule by way of a nucleic acid building block. It is appreciated that introns often have consensus sequences at both termini in order to render them operational. It is also appreciated that, in addition to enabling gene splicing, introns may serve an additional purpose by providing sites of homology to other nucleic acids to enable homologous recombination. For this purpose, and potentially others, it may be sometimes desirable to generate a large nucleic acid building block for introducing an intron. If the size is overly large easily generated by direct chemical synthesis of two single stranded oligos, such a specialized nucleic acid building block may also be generated by direct chemical synthesis of more than two single stranded oligos or by using a polymerase-based amplification reaction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Ligation Reassembly Using Fewer Than All The Nucleotides Of An Overhang. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows that coupling can occur in a manner that does not make use of every nucleotide in a participating overhang. The coupling is particularly likely to survive (e.g. in a transformed host) if the coupling reinforced by treatment with a ligase enzyme to form what may be referred to as a &#x201c;gap ligation&#x201d; or a &#x201c;gapped ligation&#x201d;. It is appreciated that, as shown, this type of coupling can contribute to generation of unwanted background product(s), but it can also be used advantageously to increase the diversity of the progeny library generated by the designed ligation reassembly. The example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows ligation of one strand only; the gap in the second strand can be repaired in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Avoidance of unwanted self-ligation in palindromic couplings. As mentioned before and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, certain overhangs are able to undergo self-coupling to form a palindromic coupling. A coupling is strengthened substantially if it is reinforced by treatment with a ligase enzyme. Accordingly, it is appreciated that the lack of 5&#x2032; phosphates on these overhangs, as shown, can be used advantageously to prevent this type of palindromic self-ligation. Accordingly, this invention provides that nucleic acid building blocks can be chemically made (or ordered) that lack a 5&#x2032; phosphate group (or alternatively they can be removed-e.g. by treatment with a phosphatase enzyme such as a calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP)&#x2014;in order to prevent palindromic self-ligations in ligation reassembly processes. This figure shows that there is no self-ligation of end primers with palindromic overhangs.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Pathway Engineering. It is a goal of this invention to provide ways of making new gene pathways using ligation reassembly, optionally with other directed evolution methods such as saturation mutagenesis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a preferred approach that may be taken to achieve this goal. It is appreciated that naturally-occurring microbial gene pathways are linked more often than naturally-occurring eukaryotic (e.g. plant) gene pathways, which are sometime only partially linked. In a particular embodiment, this invention provides that regulatory gene sequences (including promoters) can be introduced in the form of nucleic acid building blocks into progeny gene pathways generated by ligation reassembly processes. Thus, originally linked microbial gene pathways, as well as originally unlinked genes and gene pathways, can be thus converted to acquire operability in plants and other eukaryotes.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Avoidance of unwanted self-ligation in palindromic couplings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates that another goal of this invention, in addition to the generation of novel gene pathways, is the subjection of gene pathways&#x2014;both naturally occurring and man-made&#x2014;to mutagenesis and selection in order to achieve improved progeny molecules using the instantly disclosed methods of directed evolution (including saturation mutagenesis and synthetic ligation reassembly). In a particular embodiment, as provided by the instant invention, both microbial and plant pathways can be improved by directed evolution, and as shown, the directed evolution process can be performed both on genes prior to linking them into pathways, and on gene pathways themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Conversion of Microbial Pathways to Eukaryotic Pathways. In a particular embodiment, this invention provides that microbial pathways can be converted to pathways operable in plants and other eukaryotic species by the introduction of regulatory sequences that function in those species. Preferred regulatory sequences include promoters, operators, and activator binding sites. As shown, a preferred method of achieving the introduction of such serviceable regulatory sequences is in the form of nucleic acid building blocks, particularly through the use of couplings in ligation reassembly processes. These couplings in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> are marked with the letters A, B, C, D and F.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Evolution of polypeptides by synthesizing (in vivo or in vitro) corresponding deduced polynucleotides and subjecting the deduced polynucleotides to directed evolution and expression screening subsequently expressed polypeptides. This invention provides that ligation reassembly and site saturation mutagenesis are each serviceable for introducing nucleotide substitutions as well as nucleotide deletions and nucleotide additions and combinations thereof. Furthermore synthetic ligation reassembly can be performed on a plurality of starting templates as well as on a single template to rearrange the order of the nucleotide cassettes in a non-stochastic predetermined manner. Additionally, when subjecting a plurality of starting templates to ligation reassembly, it is not necessary that the same number of nucleic acid building blocks be generated from each template (e.g. to participate to in each coupling). Thus for example if three templates are used, then a different number of nucleic acid building blocks may be generated corresponding to each template.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>: In Silico Triage. This figure illustrates the grouping of potential products and the ranking of the groupings according to &#x201c;structure-function&#x201d; predictions, which steps are aspects of what is referred to herein as &#x201c;triaging&#x201d;, and specifically &#x201c;in silico triage&#x201d; if performed using the aid of a computer.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>: Solid Phase Ligation Reassembly. The outline of the procedure used is the following: (1) Annealing of complementary oligos. <?insert-start id="REI-00014"  date="20150120" ?>Oligonucleotides of 10 or more nucleotide bases are shown in SEQ ID NOS 18-22, respectively in order of appearance. <?insert-end id="REI-00014" ?>(Couplings are shown underlined and in bold. Dashes &#x201c;------&#x201d; indicate internal sequences not involved in couplings.) (2) Immobilization of 5&#x2032; pre-annealed biotinylated fragment to conjugated beads. (3) Wash to remove free fragments. (4) Enzymatic ligation of consecutive pre-annealed fragments including washes between each addition to remove free fragments. (5) BsaI-mediated elution of reassembled gene (cuts inside of TOPO sequence). (6) Ligation to 5&#x2032;- and 3&#x2032; end PCR generated fragments (if necessary). (7) Cloning into appropriate vector.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Polynucleotide reassembly. Shown is an example of directed evolution. N different strains of a virus are used in this illustration, but the technique is applicable to any single nucleic acid as well as to any nucleic acid for which different strains, species, or gene families have homologous nucleic acids that have one or more nucleotide changes compared to other homologous nucleic acids. The different variant nucleic acids are experimentally generated, preferably non-stochastically, as described herein, and screened or selected to identify those variants that exhibit the desired property. The directed evolution method(s) and screening can be repeated one or more times to obtain further improvement. Panel B shows that successive rounds of directed evolution can produce progressively enhanced properties, and that the combination of individual beneficial mutations can lead to an enhanced improvement compared to the improvement achieved by an individual beneficial mutation. This figure illustrates the non-stochastic polynucleotide reassembly in combination with non-stochastic polynucleotide site-saturation mutagenesis.</p>

While many different library formats for AME have been reported for polynucleotides, peptides and proteins (phage, lacI and polysomes), none of these formats have provided for recombination by random cross-overs to deliberately create a combinatorial library.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0109">A molecule that has a &#x201c;chimeric property&#x201d; is a molecule that is: 1) in part homologous and in part heterologous to a first reference molecule; while 2) at the same time being in part homologous and in part heterologous to a second reference molecule; without 3) precluding the possibility of being at the same time in part homologous and in part heterologous to still one or more additional reference molecules. In a non-limiting embodiment, a chimeric molecule may be prepared by assemblying a reassortment of partial molecular sequences. In a non-limiting aspect, a chimeric polynucleotide molecule may be prepared by synthesizing the chimeric polynucleotide using plurality of molecular templates, such that the resultant chimeric polynucleotide has properties of a plurality of templates.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0110">The term &#x201c;cognate&#x201d; as used herein refers to a gene sequence that is evolutionarily and functionally related between species. For example, but not limitation, in the human genome the human CD4 gene is the cognate gene to the mouse 3d4 gene, since the sequences and structures of these two genes indicate that they are highly homologous and both genes encode a protein which functions in signaling T cell activation through MHC class II-restricted antigen recognition.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0111">A &#x201c;comparison window,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a conceptual segment of at least 20 contiguous nucleotide positions wherein a polynucleotide sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of at least 20 contiguous nucleotides and wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) of 20 percent or less as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for aligning a comparison window may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith (Smith and Waterman, Adv Appl Math, 1981; Smith and Waterman, J Teor Biol, 1981; Smith and Waterman, J Mol Biol, 1981; Smith et al, J Mol Evol, 1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman (Needleman and Wuncsch, 1970), by the search of similarity method of Pearson (Pearson and Lipman, 1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by inspection, and the best alignment (i.e., resulting in the highest percentage of homology over the comparison window) generated by the various methods is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0112">As used herein, the term &#x201c;complementarity-determining region&#x201d; and &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; refer to the art-recognized term as exemplified by the Kabat and Chothia CDR definitions also generally known as supervariable regions or hypervariable loops (Chothia and Lesk, 1987; Clothia et al, 1989; Kabat et al, 1987; and Tramontano et al, 1990). Variable region domains typically comprise the amino-terminal approximately 105-115 amino acids of a naturally-occurring immunoglobulin chain (e.g., amino acids 1-110), although variable domains somewhat shorter or longer are also suitable for forming single-chain antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0113">&#x201c;Conservative amino acid substitutions&#x201d; refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains.

Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, and asparagine-glutamine.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0114">The term &#x201c;corresponds to&#x201d; is used herein to mean that a polynucleotide sequence is homologous (i.e., is identical, not strictly evolutionarily related) to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence, or that a polypeptide sequence is identical to a reference polypeptide sequence. In contradistinction, the term &#x201c;complementary to&#x201d; is used herein to mean that the complementary sequence is homologous to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence. For illustration, the nucleotide sequence &#x201c;TATAC&#x201d; corresponds to a reference &#x201c;TATAC&#x201d; and is complementary to a reference sequence &#x201c;GTATA.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0115">The term &#x201c;degrading effective&#x201d; amount refers to the amount of enzyme which is required to process at least 50% of the substrate, as compared to substrate not contacted with the enzyme. Preferably, at least 80% of the substrate is degraded.</p>

A &#x201c;defined sequence kemal&#x201d; is a set of sequences which encompass a limited scope of variability. Whereas (1) a completely random 10-mer sequence of the 20 conventional amino acids can be any of (20)<sup>10 </sup>sequences, and (2) a pseudorandom 10-mer sequence of the 20 conventional amino acids can be any of (20)<sup>10 </sup>sequences but will exhibit a bias for certain residues at certain positions and/or overall, (3) a defined sequence kernal is a subset of sequences if each residue position was allowed to be any of the allowable 20 conventional amino acids (and/or allowable unconventional amino/imino acids). A defined sequence kernal generally comprises variant and invariant residue positions and/or comprises variant residue positions which can comprise a residue selected from a defined subset of amino acid residues), and the like, either segmentally or over the entire length of the individual selected library member sequence. Defined sequence kernels can refer to either amino acid sequences or polynucleotide sequences. Of illustration and not limitation, the sequences (NNK)<sub>10 </sub>and (NNM)<sub>10</sub>, wherein N represents A, T, G, or C; K represents G or T; and M represents A or C, are defined sequence kernels.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0117">&#x201c;Digestion&#x201d; of DNA refers to catalytic cleavage of the DNA with a restriction enzyme that acts only at certain sequences in the DNA. The various restriction enzymes used herein are commercially available and their reaction conditions, cofactors and other requirements were used as would be known to the ordinarily skilled artisan. For analytical purposes, typically 1 &#x3bc;g of plasmid or DNA fragment is used with about 2 units of enzyme in about 20 &#x3bc;l of buffer solution. For the purpose of isolating DNA fragments for plasmid construction, typically 5 to 50 &#x3bc;g of DNA are digested with 20 to 250 units of enzyme in a larger volume. Appropriate buffers and substrate amounts for particular restriction enzymes are specified by the manufacturer. Incubation times of about 1 hour at 37&#xb0; C. are ordinarily used, but may vary in accordance with the supplier's instructions. After digestion the reaction is electrophoresed directly on a gel to isolate the desired fragment.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0118">&#x201c;Directional ligation&#x201d; refers to a ligation in which a 5&#x2032; end and a 3&#x2032; end of a polynuclotide are different enough to specify a preferred ligation orientation. For example, an otherwise untreated and undigested PCR product that has two blunt ends will typically be not have a preferred ligation orientation when ligated into a cloning vector digested to produce blunt ends in its multiple cloning site; thus, directional ligation will typically not be displayed under these circumstances. In contrast, directional ligation will typically displayed when a digested PCR product having a 5&#x2032; EcoR I-treated end and a 3&#x2032; BamH I-is ligated into a cloning vector that has a multiple cloning site digested with EcoR I and BamH I.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0119">The term &#x201c;DNA shuffling&#x201d; is used herein to indicate recombination between substantially homologous but non-identical sequences, in some embodiments DNA shuffling may involve crossover via non-homologous recombination, such as via cer/lox and/or flp/frt systems and the like.</p>

Antigenic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules, such as amino acids or sugar side chains, and can have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. As used herein &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; refers to that portion of an antigen or other macromolecule capable of forming a binding interaction that interacts with the variable region binding body of an antibody. Typically, such binding interaction is manifested as an intermolecular contact with one or more amino acid residues of a CDR.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0121">The terms &#x201c;fragment&#x201d;, &#x201c;derivative&#x201d; and &#x201c;analog&#x201d; when referring to a reference polypeptide comprise a polypeptide which retains at least one biological function or activity that is at least essentially same as that of the reference polypeptide. Furthermore, the terms &#x201c;fragment&#x201d;, &#x201c;derivative&#x201d; or &#x201c;analog&#x201d; are exemplified by a &#x201c;pro-form&#x201d; molecule, such as a low activity proprotein that can be modified by cleavage to produce a mature enzyme with significantly higher activity.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0122">A method is provided herein for producing from a template polypeptide a set of progeny polypeptides in which a &#x201c;full range of single amino acid substitutions&#x201d; is represented at each amino acid position. As used herein, &#x201c;full range of single amino acid substitutions&#x201d; is in reference to the naturally encoded 20 naturally encoded polypeptide-forming alpha-amino acids, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0123">The term &#x201c;gene&#x201d; means the segment of DNA involved in producing a polypeptide chain; it includes regions preceding and following the coding region (leader and trailer) as well as intervening sequences (introns) between individual coding segments (exons).</p>

Deletions tend to involve the loss of one copy of a repeat and everything between the repeats.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0125">The term &#x201c;heterologous&#x201d; means that one single-stranded nucleic acid sequence is unable to hybridize to another single-stranded nucleic acid sequence or its complement. Thus areas of heterology means that areas of polynucleotides or polynucleotides have areas or regions within their sequence which are unable to hybridize to another nucleic acid or polynucleotide. Such regions or areas are for example areas of mutations.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0126">The term &#x201c;homologous&#x201d; or &#x201c;homeologous&#x201d; means that one single-stranded nucleic acid sequence may hybridize to a complementary single-stranded nucleic acid sequence. The degree of hybridization may depend on a number of factors including the amount of identity between the sequences and the hybridization conditions such as temperature and salt concentrations as discussed later. Preferably the region of identity is greater than about 5 bp, more preferably the region of identity is greater than 10 bp.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0127">An immunoglobulin light or heavy chain variable region consists of a &#x201c;framework&#x201d; region interrupted by three hypervariable regions, also called CDR's. The extent of the framework region and CDR's have been precisely defined; see &#x201c;Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest&#x201d; (Kabat et al, 1987). The sequences of the framework regions of different light or heavy chains are relatively conserved within a specie. As used herein, a &#x201c;human framework region&#x201d; is a framework region that is substantially identical (about 85 or more, usually 90-95 or more) to the framework region of a naturally occurring human immunoglobulin. the framework region of an antibody, that is the combined framework regions of the constituent light and heavy chains, serves to position and align the CDR's. The CDR's are primarily responsible for binding to an epitope of an antigen.</p>

Relevant applications include those in areas of diagnosis, medicine, agriculture, manufacturing, and academia.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0129">The term &#x201c;identical&#x201d; or &#x201c;identity&#x201d; means that two nucleic acid sequences have the same sequence or a complementary sequence. Thus, &#x201c;areas of identity&#x201d; means that regions or areas of a polynucleotide or the overall polynucleotide are identical or complementary to areas of another polynucleotide or the polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0130">The term &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; means that the material is removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring). For example, a naturally-occurring polynucleotide or enzyme present in a living animal is not isolated, but the same polynucleotide or enzyme, separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system, is isolated. Such polynucleotides could be part of a vector and/or such polynucleotides or enzymes could be part of a composition, and still be isolated in that such vector or composition is not part of its natural environment.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0131">By &#x201c;isolated nucleic acid&#x201d; is meant a nucleic acid, e.g., a DNA or RNA molecule, that is not immediately contiguous with the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; flanking sequences with which it normally is immediately contiguous when present in the naturally occurring genome of the organism from which it is derived. The term thus describes, for example, a nucleic acid that is incorporated into a vector, such as a plasmid or viral vector; a nucleic acid that is incorporated into the genome of a heterologous cell (or the genome of a homologous cell, but at a site different from that at which it naturally occurs); and a nucleic acid that exists as a separate molecule, e.g., a DNA fragment produced by PCR amplification or restriction enzyme digestion, or an RNA molecule produced by in vitro transcription. The term also describes a recombinant nucleic acid that forms part of a hybrid gene encoding additional polypeptide sequences that can be used, for example, in the production of a fusion protein.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0132">As used herein &#x201c;ligand&#x201d; refers to a molecule, such as a random peptide or variable segment sequence, that is recognized by a particular receptor. As one of skill in the art will recognize, a molecule (or macromolecular complex) can be both a receptor and a ligand. In general, the binding partner having a smaller molecular weight is referred to as the ligand and the binding partner having a greater molecular weight is referred to as a receptor.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0133">&#x201c;Ligation&#x201d; refers to the process of forming phosphodiester bonds between two double stranded nucleic acid fragments (Sambrook et al, 1982, p. 146; Sambrook, 1989). Unless otherwise provided, ligation may be accomplished using known buffers and conditions with 10 units of T4 DNA ligase (&#x201c;ligase&#x201d;) per 0.5 &#x3bc;g of approximately equimolar amounts of the DNA fragments to be ligated.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0134">As used herein, &#x201c;linker&#x201d; or &#x201c;spacer&#x201d; refers to a molecule or group of molecules that connects two molecules, such as a DNA binding protein and a random peptide, and serves to place the two molecules in a preferred configuration, e.g., so that the random peptide can bind to a receptor with minimal steric hindrance from the DNA binding protein.</p>

Particularly relevant&#x2014;but by no means limiting&#x2014;examples of molecular properties to be evolved include enzymatic activities at specified conditions, such as related to temperature; salinity; pressure; pH; and concentration of glycerol, DMSO, detergent, &#x26;/or any other molecular species with which contact is made in a reaction environment. Additional particularly relevant&#x2014;but by no means limiting&#x2014;examples of molecular properties to be evolved include stabilities&#x2014;e.g. the amount of a residual molecular property that is present after a specified exposure time to a specified environment, such as may be encountered during storage.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0136">The term &#x201c;mutations&#x201d; includes changes in the sequence of a wild-type or parental nucleic acid sequence or changes in the sequence of a peptide. Such mutations may be point mutations such as transitions or transversions. The mutations may be deletions, insertions or duplications. A mutation can also be a &#x201c;chimerization&#x201d;, which is exemplified in a progeny molecule that is generated to contain part or all of a sequence of one parental molecule as well as part or all of a sequence of at least one other parental molecule. This invention provides for both chimeric polynucleotides and chimeric polypeptides.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0137">As used herein, the degenerate &#x201c;N,N,G/T&#x201d; nucleotide sequence represents <b>32</b> possible triplets, where &#x201c;N&#x201d; can be A, C, G or T.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0138">The term &#x201c;naturally-occurring&#x201d; as used herein as applied to the object refers to the fact that an object can be found in nature. For example, a polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory is naturally occurring. Generally, the term naturally occurring refers to an object as present in a non-pathological (un-diseased) individual, such as would be typical for the species.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0139">As used herein, a &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule&#x201d; is comprised of at least one base or one base pair, depending on whether it is single-stranded or double-stranded, respectively. Furthermore, a nucleic acid molecule may belong exclusively or chimerically to any group of nucleotide-containing molecules, as exemplified by, but not limited to, the following groups of nucleic acid molecules: RNA, DNA, genomic nucleic acids, non-genomic nucleic acids, naturally occurring and not naturally occurring nucleic acids, and synthetic nucleic acids. This includes, by way of non-limiting example, nucleic acids associated with any organelle, such as the mitochondria, ribosomal RNA, and nucleic acid molecules comprised chimerically of one or more components that are not naturally occurring along with naturally occurring components.</p>

Thus, by way of example, but not limitation, a ribozyme that is in part nucleotide-based and in part protein-based is considered a &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0141">In addition, by way of example, but not limitation, a nucleic acid molecule that is labeled with a detectable moiety, such as a radioactive or alternatively a non-radioactive label, is likewise considered a &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule&#x201d;.</p>

A &#x201c;promotor sequence&#x201d; is a DNA regulatory region capable of binding RNA polymerase in a cell and initiating transcription of a downstream (3&#x2032; direction) coding sequence. The promoter is part of the DNA sequence. This sequence region has a start codon at its 3&#x2032; terminus. The promoter sequence does include the minimum number of bases where elements necessary to initiate transcription at levels detectable above background. However, after the RNA polymerase binds the sequence and transcription is initiated at the start codon (3&#x2032; terminus with a promoter), transcription proceeds downstream in the 3&#x2032; direction. Within the promotor sequence will be found a transcription initiation site (conveniently defined by mapping with nuclease S1) as well as protein binding domains (consensus sequences) responsible for the binding of RNA polymerase.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0143">The terms &#x201c;nucleic acid encoding an enzyme (protein)&#x201d; or &#x201c;DNA encoding an enzyme (protein)&#x201d; or &#x201c;polynucleotide encoding an enzyme (protein)&#x201d; and other synonymous terms encompasses a polynucleotide which includes only coding sequence for the enzyme as well as a polynucleotide which includes additional coding and/or non-coding sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0144">In one preferred embodiment, a &#x201c;specific nucleic acid molecule species&#x201d; is defined by its chemical structure, as exemplified by, but not limited to, its primary sequence. In another preferred embodiment, a specific &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule species&#x201d; is defined by a function of the nucleic acid species or by a function of a product derived from the nucleic acid species. Thus, by way of non-limiting example, a &#x201c;specific nucleic acid molecule species&#x201d; may be defined by one or more activities or properties attributable to it, including activities or properties attributable its expressed product.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0145">The instant definition of &#x201c;assembling a working nucleic acid sample into a nucleic acid library&#x201d; includes the process of incorporating a nucleic acid sample into a vector-based collection, such as by ligation into a vector and transformation of a host. A description of relevant vectors, hosts, and other reagents as well as specific non-limiting examples thereof are provided hereinafter. The instant definition of &#x201c;assembling a working nucleic acid sample into a nucleic acid library&#x201d; also includes the process of incorporating a nucleic acid sample into a non-vector-based collection, such as by ligation to adaptors. Preferably the adaptors can anneal to PCR primers to facilitate amplification by PCR.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0146">Accordingly, in a non-limiting embodiment, a &#x201c;nucleic acid library&#x201d; is comprised of a vector-based collection of one or more nucleic acid molecules.

In a specific&#x2014;but by no means limiting&#x2014;aspect, a nucleotide construct is exemplified by DNA expression constructs suitable for the transformation of a host cell.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0148">An &#x201c;oligonucleotide&#x201d; (or synonymously an &#x201c;oligo&#x201d;) refers to either a single stranded polydeoxynucleotide or two complementary polydeoxynucleotide strands which may be chemically synthesized. Such synthetic oligonucleotides may or may not have a 5&#x2032; phosphate. Those that do not will not ligate to another oligonucleotide without adding a phosphate with an ATP in the presence of a kinase. A synthetic oligonucleotide will ligate to a fragment that has not been dephosphorylated. To achieve polymerase-based amplification (such as with PCR), a &#x201c;32-fold degenerate oligonucleotide that is comprised of, in series, at least a first homologous sequence, a degenerate N,N,G/T sequence, and a second homologous sequence&#x201d; is mentioned. As used in this context, &#x201c;homologous&#x201d; is in reference to homology between the oligo and the parental polynucleotide that is subjected to the polymerase-based amplification.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0149">As used herein, the term &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; refers to a linkage of polynucleotide elements in a functional relationship. A nucleic acid is &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the coding sequence. Operably linked means that the DNA sequences being linked are typically contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein coding regions, contiguous and in reading frame.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0150">A coding sequence is &#x201c;operably linked to&#x201d; another coding sequence when RNA polymerase will transcribe the two coding sequences into a single mRNA, which is then translated into a single polypeptide having amino acids derived from both coding sequences. The coding sequences need not be contiguous to one another so long as the expressed sequences are ultimately processed to produce the desired protein.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0151">As used herein the term &#x201c;parental polynucleotide set&#x201d; is a set comprised of one or more distinct polynucleotide species.

Suitable in vitro reaction conditions for in vitro transcription cocktails are generally physiological conditions. In general, in vitro physiological conditions comprise 50-200 mM NaCl or KCl, pH 6.5-8.5, 20-45&#xb0; C. and 0.001-10 mM divalent cation (e.g., Mg<sup>++</sup>, Ca<sup>++</sup>); preferably about 150 mM NaCl or KCl, pH 7.2-7.6, 5 mM divalent cation, and often include 0.01-1.0 percent nonspecific protein (e.g., BSA). A non-ionic detergent (Tween, NP-40, Triton X-100) can often be present, usually at about 0.001 to 2%, typically 0.05-0.2% (v/v). Particular aqueous conditions may be selected by the practitioner according to conventional methods. For general guidance, the following buffered aqueous conditions may be applicable: 10-250 mM NaCl, 5-50 mM Tris HCl, pH 5-8, with optional addition of divalent cation(s) and/or metal chelators and/or non-ionic detergents and/or membrane fractions and/or anti-foam agents and/or scintillants.</p>

When two or more chemical modification (e.g. two proteolytic cleavages, or a proteolytic cleavage and a deglycosylation) can be distinguished en route to the production of a mature molecule, the referemce precursor molecule may be termed a &#x201c;pre-pro-form&#x201d; molecule.</p>

Indeed the method is proposed not only for practically identical encoding units produced by mutagenesis of the identical starting sequence, but also the reassortment of similar or related sequences which may diverge significantly in some regions. Nevertheless, if the sequences contain sufficient homologies to be reasserted by this approach, they can be referred to as &#x201c;quasi-repeated&#x201d; units.</p>

A random peptide can include framework or scaffolding motifs, which may comprise invariant sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0160">As used herein, &#x201c;receptor&#x201d; refers to a molecule that has an affinity for a given ligand. Receptors can be naturally occurring or synthetic molecules. Receptors can be employed in an unaltered state or as aggregates with other species. Receptors can be attached, covalently or non-covalently, to a binding member, either directly or via a specific binding substance. Examples of receptors include, but are not limited to, antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies and antisera reactive with specific antigenic determinants (such as on viruses, cells, or other materials), cell membrane receptors, complex carbohydrates and glycoproteins, enzymes, and hormone receptors.</p>

<p id="p-0147" num="0162">The term &#x201c;related polynucleotides&#x201d; means that regions or areas of the polynucleotides are identical and regions or areas of the polynucleotides are heterologous.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0163">&#x201c;Reductive reassortment&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to the increase in molecular diversity that is accrued through deletion (and/or insertion) events that are mediated by repeated sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0164">The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between two or more polynucleotides: &#x201c;reference sequence,&#x201d; &#x201c;comparison window,&#x201d; &#x201c;sequence identity,&#x201d; &#x201c;percentage of sequence identity,&#x201d; and &#x201c;substantial identity.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0165">A &#x201c;reference sequence&#x201d; is a defined sequence used as a basis for a sequence comparison; a reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence, for example, as a segment of a full-length cDNA or gene sequence given in a sequence listing, or may comprise a complete cDNA or gene sequence. Generally, a reference sequence is at least nucleotides in length, frequently at least 25 nucleotides in length, and often at least 50 nucleotides in length. Since two polynucleotides may each (1) comprise a sequence (i.e., a portion of the complete polynucleotide sequence) that is similar between the two polynucleotides and (2) may further comprise a sequence that is divergent between the two polynucleotides, sequence comparisons between two (or more) polynucleotides are typically performed by comparing sequences of the two polynucleotides over a &#x201c;comparison window&#x201d; to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0166">&#x201c;Repetitive Index (RI)&#x201d;, as used herein, is the average number of copies of the quasi-repeated units contained in the cloning vector.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0167">The term &#x201c;restriction site&#x201d; refers to a recognition sequence that is necessary for the manifestation of the action of a restriction enzyme, and includes a site of catalytic cleavage. It is appreciated that a site of cleavage may or may not be contained within a portion of a restriction site that comprises a low ambiguity sequence (i.e. a sequence containing the principal determinant of the frequency of occurrence of the restriction site). Thus, in many cases, relevant restriction sites contain only a low ambiguity sequence with an internal cleavage site (e.g. G/AATTC in the EcoR I site) or an immediately adjacent cleavage site (e.g. /CCWGG in the EcoR II site). In other cases, relevant restriction enzymes [e.g. the Eco57 I site or CTGAAG(16/14) <?insert-start id="REI-00020"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 24)<?insert-end id="REI-00020" ?>] contain a low ambiguity sequence (e.g. the CTGAAG sequence in the Eco57 I site) with an external cleavage site (e.g. in the N<sub>16 </sub>portion of the Eco57 I site). When an enzyme (e.g. a restriction enzyme) is said to &#x201c;cleave&#x201d; a polynucleotide, it is understood to mean that the restriction enzyme catalyzes or facilitates a cleavage of a polynucleotide.</p>

As used in this aspect, a 5&#x2032; terminal region is a region that is located towards a 5&#x2032; polynucleotide terminus (or a 5&#x2032; polynucleotide end); thus it is either partially or entirely in a 5&#x2032; half of a polynucleotide. Likewise, a 3&#x2032; terminal region is a region that is located towards a 3&#x2032; polynucleotide terminus (or a 3&#x2032; polynucleotide end); thus it is either partially or entirely in a 3&#x2032; half of a polynucleotide.

<p id="p-0154" num="0169">The term &#x201c;sequence identity&#x201d; means that two polynucleotide sequences are identical (i.e., on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide basis) over the window of comparison. The term &#x201c;percentage of sequence identity&#x201d; is calculated by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over the window of comparison, determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base (e.g., A, T, C, G, U, or I) occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison (i.e., the window size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. This &#x201c;substantial identity&#x201d;, as used herein, denotes a characteristic of a polynucleotide sequence, wherein the polynucleotide comprises a sequence having at least 80 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 85 percent identity, often 90 to 95 percent sequence identity, and most commonly at least 99 percent sequence identity as compared to a reference sequence of a comparison window of at least 25-50 nucleotides, wherein the percentage of sequence identity is calculated by comparing the reference sequence to the polynucleotide sequence which may include deletions or additions which total 20 percent or less of the reference sequence over the window of comparison.</p>

<p id="p-0156" num="0171">As used herein, the term &#x201c;single-chain antibody&#x201d; refers to a polypeptide comprising a V<sub>H </sub>domain and a V<sub>L </sub>domain in polypeptide linkage, generall linked via a spacer peptide (e.g., [Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser]<sub>x </sub><?insert-start id="REI-00021"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 25)<?insert-end id="REI-00021" ?>), and which may comprise additional amino acid sequences at the amino- and/or carboxy-termini. For example, a single-chain antibody may comprise a tether segment for linking to the encoding polynucleotide. As an example, a scFv is a single-chain antibody. Single-chain antibodies are generally proteins consisting of one or more polypeptide segments of at least 10 contiguous amino substantially encoded by genes of the immunoglobulin superfamily (e.g., see Williams and Barclay, 1989, pp. 361-368, which is incorporated herein by reference), most frequently encoded by a rodent, non-human primate, avian, porcine bovine, ovine, goat, or human heavy chain or light chain gene sequence. A functional single-chain antibody generally contains a sufficient portion of an immunoglobulin superfamily gene product so as to retain the property of binding to a specific target molecule, typically a receptor or antigen (epitope).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0172">The members of a pair of molecules (e.g., an antibody-antigen pair or a nucleic acid pair) are said to &#x201c;specifically bind&#x201d; to each other if they bind to each other with greater affinity than to other, non-specific molecules. For example, an antibody raised against an antigen to which it binds more efficiently than to a non-specific protein can be described as specifically binding to the antigen. (Similarly, a nucleic acid probe can be described as specifically binding to a nucleic acid target if it forms a specific duplex with the target by base pairing interactions (see above).)</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0173">&#x201c;Specific hybridization&#x201d; is defined herein as the formation of hybrids between a first polynucleotide and a second polynucleotide (e.g., a polynucleotide having a distinct but substantially identical sequence to the first polynucleotide), wherein substantially unrelated polynucleotide sequences do not form hybrids in the mixture.</p>

<p id="p-0160" num="0175">&#x201c;Stringent hybridization conditions&#x201d; means hybridization will occur only if there is at least 90% identity, preferably at least 95% identity and most preferably at least 97% identity between the sequences.

<p id="p-0161" num="0176">Also included in the invention are polypeptides having sequences that are &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; to the sequence of a phytase polypeptide, such as one of SEQ ID 1. A &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; amino acid sequence is a sequence that differs from a reference sequence only by conservative amino acid substitutions, for example, substitutions of one amino acid for another of the same class (e.g., substitution of one hydrophobic amino acid, such as isoleucine, valine, leucine, or methionine, for another, or substitution of one polar amino acid for another, such as substitution of arginine for lysine, glutamic acid for aspartic acid, or glutamine for asparagine).</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0177">Additionally a &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; amino acid sequence is a sequence that differs from a reference sequence or by one or more non-conservative substitutions, deletions, or insertions, particularly when such a substitution occurs at a site that is not the active site the molecule, and provided that the polypeptide essentially retains its behavioural properties. For example, one or more amino acids can be deleted from a phytase polypeptide, resulting in modification of the structure of the polypeptide, without significantly altering its biological activity. For example, amino- or carboxyl-terminal amino acids that are not required for phytase biological activity can be removed. Such modifications can result in the development of smaller active phytase polypeptides.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0178">The present invention provides a &#x201c;substantially pure enzyme&#x201d;. The term &#x201c;substantially pure enzyme&#x201d; is used herein to describe a molecule, such as a polypeptide (e.g., a phytase polypeptide, or a fragment thereof) that is substantially free of other proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and other biological materials with which it is naturally associated. For example, a substantially pure molecule, such as a polypeptide, can be at least 60%, by dry weight, the molecule of interest. The purity of the polypeptides can be determined using standard methods including, e.g., polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (e.g., SDS-PAGE), column chromatography (e.g., high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)), and amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0179">As used herein, &#x201c;substantially pure&#x201d; means an object species is the predominant species present (i.e., on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other individual macromolecular species in the composition), and preferably substantially purified fraction is a composition wherein the object species comprises at least about 50 percent (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species present. Generally, a substantially pure composition will comprise more than about 80 to 90 percent of all macromolecular species present in the composition. Most preferably, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity (contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods) wherein the composition consists essentially of a single macromolecular species. Solvent species, small molecules (&#x3c;500 Daltons), and elemental ion species are not considered macromolecular species.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0180">As used herein, the term &#x201c;variable segment&#x201d; refers to a portion of a nascent peptide which comprises a random, pseudorandom, or defined kernal sequence. A variable segment&#x201d; refers to a portion of a nascent peptide which comprises a random pseudorandom, or defined kernal sequence. A variable segment can comprise both variant and invariant residue positions, and the degree of residue variation at a variant residue position may be limited: both options are selected at the discretion of the practitioner. Typically, variable segments are about 5 to 20 amino acid residues in length (e.g., 8 to 10), although variable segments may be longer and may comprise antibody portions or receptor proteins, such as an antibody fragment, a nucleic acid binding protein, a receptor protein, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0181">The term &#x201c;wild-type&#x201d; means that the polynucleotide does not comprise any mutations. A &#x201c;wild type&#x201d; protein means that the protein will be active at a level of activity found in nature and will comprise the amino acid sequence found in nature.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0168" num="0183">The invention described herein is directed to the use of repeated cycles of reductive reassortment, recombination and selection which allow for the directed molecular evolution of highly complex linear sequences, such as DNA, RNA or proteins thorough recombination.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0184">In vivo shuffling of molecules can be performed utilizing the natural property of cells to recombine multimers. While recombination in vivo has provided the major natural route to molecular diversity, genetic recombination remains a relatively complex process that involves 1) the recognition of homologies; 2) strand cleavage, strand invasion, and metabolic steps leading to the production of recombinant chiasma; and finally 3) the resolution of chiasma into discrete recombined molecules. The formation of the chiasma requires the recognition of homologous sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0185">In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a method for producing a hybrid polynucleotide from at least a first polynucleotide and a second polynucleotide. The present invention can be used to produce a hybrid polynucleotide by introducing at least a first polynucleotide and a second polynucleotide which share at least one region of partial sequence homology into a suitable host cell. The regions of partial sequence homology promote processes which result in sequence reorganization producing a hybrid polynucleotide. The term &#x201c;hybrid polynucleotide&#x201d;, as used herein, is any nucleotide sequence which results from the method of the present invention and contains sequence from at least two original polynucleotide sequences. Such hybrid polynucleotides can result from intermolecular recombination events which promote sequence integration between DNA molecules. In addition, such hybrid polynucleotides can result from intramolecular reductive reassortment processes which utilize repeated sequences to alter a nucleotide sequence within a DNA molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0186">The invention provides a means for generating hybrid polynucleotides which may encode biologically active hybrid polypeptides. In one aspect, the original polynucleotides encode biologically active polypeptides. The method of the invention produces new hybrid polypeptides by utilizing cellular processes which integrate the sequence of the original polynucleotides such that the resulting hybrid polynucleotide encodes a polypeptide demonstrating activities derived from the original biologically active polypeptides. For example, the original polynucleotides may encode a particular enzyme from different microorganisms. An enzyme encoded by a first polynucleotide from one organism may, for example, function effectively under a particular environmental condition, e.g. high salinity. An enzyme encoded by a second polynucleotide from a different organism may function effectively under a different environmental condition, such as extremely high temperatures. A hybrid polynucleotide containing sequences from the first and second original polynucleotides may encode an enzyme which exhibits characteristics of both enzymes encoded by the original polynucleotides. Thus, the enzyme encoded by the hybrid polynucleotide may function effectively under environmental conditions shared by each of the enzymes encoded by the first and second polynucleotides, e.g., high salinity and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0187">Enzymes encoded by the original polynucleotides of the invention include, but are not limited to; oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases and ligases. A hybrid polypeptide resulting from the method of the invention may exhibit specialized enzyme activity not displayed in the original enzymes. For example, following recombination and/or reductive reassortment of polynucleotides encoding hydrolase activities, the resulting hybrid polypeptide encoded by a hybrid polynucleotide can be screened for specialized hydrolase activities obtained from each of the original enzymes, i.e. the type of bond on which the hydrolase acts and the temperature at which the hydrolase functions. Thus, for example, the hydrolase may be screened to ascertain those chemical functionalities which distinguish the hybrid hydrolase from the original hydrolyases, such as: (a) amide (peptide bonds), i.e. proteases; (b) ester bonds, i.e. esterases and lipases; (c) acetals, i.e., glycosidases and, for example, the temperature, pH or salt concentration at which the hybrid polypeptide functions.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0188">Sources of the original polynucleotides may be isolated from individual organisms (&#x201c;isolates&#x201d;), collections of organisms that have been grown in defined media (&#x201c;enrichment cultures&#x201d;), or, most preferably, uncultivated organisms (&#x201c;environmental samples&#x201d;). The use of a culture-independent approach to derive polynucleotides encoding novel bioactivities from environmental samples is most preferable since it allows one to access untapped resources of biodiversity.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0189">&#x201c;Environmental libraries&#x201d; are generated from environmental samples and represent the collective genomes of naturally occurring organisms archived in cloning vectors that can be propagated in suitable prokaryotic hosts. Because the cloned DNA is initially extracted directly from environmental samples, the libraries are not limited to the small fraction of prokaryotes that can be grown in pure culture. Additionally, a normalization of the environmental DNA present in these samples could allow more equal representation of the DNA from all of the species present in the original sample. This can dramatically increase the efficiency of finding interesting genes from minor constituents of the sample which may be under-represented by several orders of magnitude compared to the dominant species.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0190">For example, gene libraries generated from one or more uncultivated microorganisms are screened for an activity of interest. Potential pathways encoding bioactive molecules of interest are first captured in prokaryotic cells in the form of gene expression libraries. Polynucleotides encoding activities of interest are isolated from such libraries and introduced into a host cell. The host cell is grown under conditions which promote recombination and/or reductive reassortment creating potentially active biomolecules with novel or enhanced activities.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0191">The microorganisms from which the polynucleotide may be prepared include prokaryotic microorganisms, such as Eubacteria and Archaebacteria, and lower eukaryotic microorganisms such as fungi, some algae and protozoa. Polynucleotides may be isolated from environmental samples in which case the nucleic acid may be recovered without culturing of an organism or recovered from one or more cultured organisms. In one aspect, such microorganisms may be extremophiles, such as hyperthermophiles, psychrophiles, psychrotrophs, halophiles, barophiles and acidophiles. Polynucleotides encoding enzymes isolated from extremophilic microorganisms are particularly preferred. Such enzymes may function at temperatures above 100&#xb0; C. in terrestrial hot springs and deep sea thermal vents, at temperatures below 0&#xb0; C. in arctic waters, in the saturated salt environment of the Dead Sea, at pH values around 0 in coal deposits and geothermal sulfur-rich springs, or at pH values greater than 11 in sewage sludge. For example, several esterases and lipases cloned and expressed from extremophilic organisms show high activity throughout a wide range of temperatures and pHs.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0192">Polynucleotides selected and isolated as hereinabove described are introduced into a suitable host cell. A suitable host cell is any cell which is capable of promoting recombination and/or reductive reassortment. The selected polynucleotides are preferably already in a vector which includes appropriate control sequences. The host cell can be a higher eukaryotic cell, such as a mammalian cell, or a lower eukaryotic cell, such as a yeast cell, or preferably, the host cell can be a prokaryotic cell, such as a bacterial cell. Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-Dextran mediated transfection, or electroporation (Davis et al, 1986).</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0193">As representative examples of appropriate hosts, there may be mentioned: bacterial cells, such as E. coli, Streptomyces, Salmonella typhimurium; fungal cells, such as yeast; insect cells such as Drosophila S2 and Spodoptera Sf9; animal cells such as CHO, COS or Bowes melanoma; adenoviruses; and plant cells. The selection of an appropriate host is deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0194">With particular references to various mammalian cell culture systems that can be employed to express recombinant protein, examples of mammalian expression systems include the COS-7 lines of monkey kidney fibroblasts, described in &#x201c;SV40-transformed simian cells support the replication of early SV40 mutants&#x201d; (Gluzman, 1981), and other cell lines capable of expressing a compatible vector, for example, the C127, 3T3, CHO, HeLa and BHK cell lines. Mammalian expression vectors will comprise an origin of replication, a suitable promoter and enhancer, and also any necessary ribosome binding sites, polyadenylation site, splice donor and acceptor sites, transcriptional termination sequences, and 5&#x2032; flanking nontranscribed sequences. DNA sequences derived from the SV40 splice, and polyadenylation sites may be used to provide the required nontranscribed genetic elements.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0195">Host cells containing the polynucleotides of interest can be cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for activating promoters, selecting transformants or amplifying genes. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan. The clones which are identified as having the specified enzyme activity may then be sequenced to identify the polynucleotide sequence encoding an enzyme having the enhanced activity.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0196">In another aspect, it is envisioned the method of the present invention can be used to generate novel polynucleotides encoding biochemical pathways from one or more operons or gene clusters or portions thereof. For example, bacteria and many eukaryotes have a coordinated mechanism for regulating genes whose products are involved in related processes. The genes are clustered, in structures referred to as &#x201c;gene clusters,&#x201d; on a single chromosome and are transcribed together under the control of a single regulatory sequence, including a single promoter which initiates transcription of the entire cluster. Thus, a gene cluster is a group of adjacent genes that are either identical or related, usually as to their function. An example of a biochemical pathway encoded by gene clusters are polyketides. Polyketides are molecules which are an extremely rich source of bioactivities, including antibiotics (such as tetracyclines and erythromycin), anti-cancer agents (daunomycin), immunosuppressants (FK506 and rapamycin), and veterinary products (monensin). Many polyketides (produced by polyketide synthases) are valuable as therapeutic agents. Polyketide synthases are multifunctional enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of an enormous variety of carbon chains differing in length and patterns of functionality and cyclization. Polyketide synthase genes fall into gene clusters and at least one type (designated type I) of polyketide synthases have large size genes and enzymes, complicating genetic manipulation and in vitro studies of these genes/proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0197">The ability to select and combine desired components from a library of polyketides, or fragments thereof, and postpolyketide biosynthesis genes for generation of novel polyketides for study is appealing. The method of the present invention makes it possible to facilitate the production of novel polyketide synthases through intermolecular recombination.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0198">Preferably, gene cluster DNA can be isolated from different organisms and ligated into vectors, particularly vectors containing expression regulatory sequences which can control and regulate the production of a detectable protein or protein-related array activity from the ligated gene clusters. Use of vectors which have an exceptionally large capacity for exogenous DNA introduction are particularly appropriate for use with such gene clusters and are described by way of example herein to include the f-factor (or fertility factor) of E. coli. This f-factor of E. coli is a plasmid which affect high-frequency transfer of itself during conjugation and is ideal to achieve and stably propagate large DNA fragments, such as gene clusters from mixed microbial samples. Once ligated into an appropriate vector, two or more vectors containing different polyketide synthase gene clusters can be introduced into a suitable host cell. Regions of partial sequence homology shared by the gene clusters will promote processes which result in sequence reorganization resulting in a hybrid gene cluster. The novel hybrid gene cluster can then be screened for enhanced activities not found in the original gene clusters.</p>

<p id="p-0186" num="0206">As representative examples of expression vectors which may be used there may be mentioned viral particles, baculovirus, phage, plasmids, phagemids, cosmids, fosmids, bacterial artificial chromosomes, viral DNA (e.g. vaccinia, adenovirus, foul pox virus, pseudorabies and derivatives of SV40), P1-based artificial chromosomes, yeast plasmids, yeast artificial chromosomes, and any other vectors specific for specific hosts of interest (such as bacillus, aspergillus and yeast). Thus, for example, the DNA may be included in any one of a variety of expression vectors for expressing a polypeptide. Such vectors include chromosomal, nonchromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences. Large numbers of suitable vectors are known to those of skill in the art, and are commercially available. The following vectors are provided by way of example; Bacterial: pQE vectors (Qiagen), pBluescript plasmids, pNH vectors, (lambda-ZAP vectors (Stratagene); ptrc99a, pKK223-3, pDR540, pRIT2T (Pharmacia); Eukaryotic: pXT1, pSG5 (Stratagene), pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG, pSVLSV40 (Pharmacia). However, any other plasmid or other vector may be used as long as they are replicable and viable in the host. Low copy number or high copy number vectors may be employed with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0207">A preferred type of vector for use in the present invention contains an f-factor origin replication. The f-factor (or fertility factor) in E. coli is a plasmid which effects high frequency transfer of itself during conjugation and less frequent transfer of the bacterial chromosome itself. A particularly preferred embodiment is to use cloning vectors, referred to as &#x201c;fosmids&#x201d; or bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vectors. These are derived from E. coli f-factor which is able to stably integrate large segments of genomic DNA. When integrated with DNA from a mixed uncultured environmental sample, this makes it possible to achieve large genomic fragments in the form of a stable &#x201c;environmental DNA library.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0208">Another preferred type of vector for use in the present invention is a cosmid vector. Cosmid vectors were originally designed to clone and propagate large segments of genomic DNA. Cloning into cosmid vectors is described in detail in &#x201c;Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual&#x201d; (Sambrook et al, 1989).</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0209">The DNA sequence in the expression vector is operatively linked to an appropriate expression control sequence(s) (promoter) to direct RNA synthesis. Particular named bacterial promoters include lacI, lacZ, T3, T7, gpt, lambda P<sub>R</sub>, P<sub>L </sub>and trp. Eukaryotic promoters include CMV immediate early, HSV thymidine kinase, early and late SV40, LTRs from retrovirus, and mouse metallothionein-I. Selection of the appropriate vector and promoter is well within the level of ordinary skill in the art. The expression vector also contains a ribosome binding site for translation initiation and a transcription terminator. The vector may also include appropriate sequences for amplifying expression. Promoter regions can be selected from any desired gene using CAT (chloramphenicol transferase) vectors or other vectors with selectable markers.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0210">In addition, the expression vectors preferably contain one or more selectable marker genes to provide a phenotypic trait for selection of transformed host cells such as dihydrofolate reductase or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture, or such as tetracycline or ampicillin resistance in E. coli.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0211">Generally, recombinant expression vectors will include origins of replication and selectable markers permitting transformation of the host cell, e.g., the ampicillin resistance gene of E. coli and S. cerevisiae TRP1 gene, and a promoter derived from a highly-expressed gene to direct transcription of a downstream structural sequence. Such promoters can be derived from operons encoding glycolytic enzymes such as 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), &#x3b1;-factor, acid phosphatase, or heat shock proteins, among others. The heterologous structural sequence is assembled in appropriate phase with translation initiation and termination sequences, and preferably, a leader sequence capable of directing secretion of translated protein into the periplasmic space or extracellular medium.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0212">The cloning strategy permits expression via both vector driven and endogenous promoters; vector promotion may be important with expression of genes whose endogenous promoter will not function in E. coli.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0213">The DNA isolated or derived from microorganisms can preferably be inserted into a vector or a plasmid prior to probing for selected DNA. Such vectors or plasmids are preferably those containing expression regulatory sequences, including promoters, enhancers and the like. Such polynucleotides can be part of a vector and/or a composition and still be isolated, in that such vector or composition is not part of its natural environment. Particularly preferred phage or plasmid and methods for introduction and packaging into them are described in detail in the protocol set forth herein.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0214">The selection of the cloning vector depends upon the approach taken, for example, the vector can be any cloning vector with an adequate capacity to multiply repeated copies of a sequence, or multiple sequences that can be successfully transformed and selected in a host cell. One example of such a vector is described in &#x201c;Polycos vectors: a system for packaging filamentous phage and phagemid vectors using lambda phage packaging extracts&#x201d; (Alting-Mecs and Short, 1993). Propagation/maintenance can be by an antibiotic resistance carried by the cloning vector. After a period of growth, the naturally abbreviated molecules are recovered and identified by size fractionation on a gel or column, or amplified directly. The cloning vector utilized may contain a selectable gene that is disrupted by the insertion of the lengthy construct. As reductive reassortment progresses, the number of repeated units is reduced and the interrupted gene is again expressed and hence selection for the processed construct can be applied. The vector may be an expression/selection vector which will allow for the selection of an expressed product possessing desirable biologically properties. The insert may be positioned downstream of a functional promotor and the desirable property screened by appropriate means.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0215">In vivo reassortment is focused on &#x201c;inter-molecular&#x201d; processes collectively referred to as &#x201c;recombination&#x201d; which in bacteria, is generally viewed as a &#x201c;RecA-dependent&#x201d; phenomenon. The present invention can rely on recombination processes of a host cell to recombine and re-assort sequences, or the cells' ability to mediate reductive processes to decrease the complexity of quasi-repeated sequences in the cell by deletion. This process of &#x201c;reductive reassortment&#x201d; occurs by an &#x201c;intra-molecular&#x201d;, RecA-independent process.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0216">Therefore, in another aspect of the present invention, novel polynucleotides can be generated by the process of reductive reassortment. The method involves the generation of constructs containing consecutive sequences (original encoding sequences), their insertion into an appropriate vector, and their subsequent introduction into an appropriate host cell. The reassortment of the individual molecular identities occurs by combinatorial processes between the consecutive sequences in the construct possessing regions of homology, or between quasi-repeated units. The reassertment process recombines and/or reduces the complexity and extent of the repeated sequences, and results in the production of novel molecular species. Various treatments may be applied to enhance the rate of reassortment. These could include treatment with ultra-violet light, or DNA damaging chemicals, and/or the use of host cell lines displaying enhanced levels of &#x201c;genetic instability&#x201d;. Thus the reassortment process may involve homologous recombination or the natural property of quasi-repeated sequences to direct their own evolution.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0217">Repeated or &#x201c;quasi-repeated&#x201d; sequences play a role in genetic instability. In the present invention, &#x201c;quasi-repeats&#x201d; are repeats that are not restricted to their original unit structure. Quasi-repeated units can be presented as an array of sequences in a construct; consecutive units of similar sequences. Once ligated, the junctions between the consecutive sequences become essentially invisible and the quasi-repetitive nature of the resulting construct is now continuous at the molecular level. The deletion process the cell performs to reduce the complexity of the resulting construct operates between the quasi-repeated sequences. The quasi-repeated units provide a practically limitless repertoire of templates upon which slippage events can occur. The constructs containing the quasi-repeats thus effectively provide sufficient molecular elasticity that deletion (and potentially insertion) events can occur virtually anywhere within the quasi-repetitive units.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0218">When the quasi-repeated sequences are all ligated in the same orientation, for instance head to tail or vice versa, the cell cannot distinguish individual units. Consequently, the reductive process can occur throughout the sequences. In contrast, when for example, the units are presented head to head, rather than head to tail, the inversion delineates the endpoints of the adjacent unit so that deletion formation will favor the loss of discrete units. Thus, it is preferable with the present method that the sequences are in the same orientation. Random orientation of quasi-repeated sequences will result in the loss of reassortment efficiency, while consistent orientation of the sequences will offer the highest efficiency. However, while having fewer of the contiguous sequences in the same orientation decreases the efficiency, it may still provide sufficient elasticity for the effective recovery of novel molecules. Constructs can be made with the quasi-repeated sequences in the same orientation to allow higher efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0219">Sequences can be assembled in a head to tail orientation using any of a variety of methods, including the following:
<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0220">a) Primers that include a poly-A head and poly-T tail which when made single-stranded would provide orientation can be utilized. This is accomplished by having the first few bases of the primers made from RNA and hence easily removed RNAseH.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0221">b) Primers that include unique restriction cleavage sites can be utilized. Multiple sites, a battery of unique sequences, and repeated synthesis and ligation steps would be required.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0222">c) The inner few bases of the primer could be thiolated and an exonuclease used to produce properly tailed molecules.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0223">The recovery of the re-assorted sequences relies on the identification of cloning vectors with a reduced RI. The re-assorted encoding sequences can then be recovered by amplification. The products are re-cloned and expressed. The recovery of cloning vectors with reduced RI can be effected by:
<ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0224">1) The use of vectors only stably maintained when the construct is reduced in complexity.</li>
    <li id="ul0011-0002" num="0225">2) The physical recovery of shortened vectors by physical procedures. In this case, the cloning vector would be recovered using standard plasmid isolation procedures and size fractionated on either an agarose gel, or column with a low molecular weight cut off utilizing standard procedures.</li>
    <li id="ul0011-0003" num="0226">3) The recovery of vectors containing interrupted genes which can be selected when insert size decreases.</li>
    <li id="ul0011-0004" num="0227">4) The use of direct selection techniques with an expression vector and the appropriate selection.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0228">Encoding sequences (for example, genes) from related organisms may demonstrate a high degree of homology and encode quite diverse protein products. These types of sequences are particularly useful in the present invention as quasi-repeats. However, while the examples illustrated below demonstrate the reassortment of nearly identical original encoding sequences (quasi-repeats), this process is not limited to such nearly identical repeats.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0229">The following example demonstrates the method of the invention. Encoding nucleic acid sequences (quasi-repeats) derived from three (3) unique species are depicted. Each sequence encodes a protein with a distinct set of properties. Each of the sequences differs by a single or a few base pairs at a unique position in the sequence which are designated &#x201c;A&#x201d;, &#x201c;B&#x201d; and &#x201c;C&#x201d;. The quasi-repeated sequences are separately or collectively amplified and ligated into random assemblies such that all possible permutations and combinations are available in the population of ligated molecules. The number of quasi-repeat units can be controlled by the assembly conditions. The average number of quasi-repeated units in a construct is defined as the repetitive index (RI).</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0230">Once formed, the constructs may, or may not be size fractionated on an agarose gel according to published protocols, inserted into a cloning vector, and transfected into an appropriate host cell. The cells are then propagated and &#x201c;reductive reassortment&#x201d; is effected. The rate of the reductive reassortment process may be stimulated by the introduction of DNA damage if desired. Whether the reduction in RI is mediated by deletion formation between repeated sequences by an &#x201c;intra-molecular&#x201d; mechanism, or mediated by recombination-like events through &#x201c;inter-molecular&#x201d; mechanisms is immaterial. The end result is a reassortment of the molecules into all possible combinations.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0231">Optionally, the method comprises the additional step of screening the library members of the shuffled pool to identify individual shuffled library members having the ability to bind or otherwise interact (e.g., such as catalytic antibodies) with a predetermined macromolecule, such as for example a proteinaceous receptor, peptide oligosaccharide, viron, or other predetermined compound or structure.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0232">The displayed polypeptides, antibodies, peptidomimetic antibodies, and variable region sequences that are identified from such libraries can be used for therapeutic, diagnostic, research and related purposes (e.g., catalysts, solutes for increasing osmolarity of an aqueous solution, and the like), and/or can be subjected to one or more additional cycles of shuffling and/or affinity selection. The method can be modified such that the step of selecting for a phenotypic characteristic can be other than of binding affinity for a predetermined molecule (e.g., for catalytic activity, stability oxidation resistance, drug resistance, or detectable phenotype conferred upon a host cell).</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0233">The present invention provides a method for generating libraries of displayed antibodies suitable for affinity interactions screening. The method comprises (1) obtaining first a plurality of selected library members comprising a displayed antibody and an associated polynucleotide encoding said displayed antibody, and obtaining said associated polynucleotide encoding for said displayed antibody and obtaining said associated polynucleotides or copies thereof, wherein said associated polynucleotides comprise a region of substantially identical variable region framework sequence, and (2) introducing said polynucleotides into a suitable host cell and growing the cells under conditions which promote recombination and reductive reassortment resulting in shuffled polynucleotides. CDR combinations comprised by the shuffled pool are not present in the first plurality of selected library members, said shuffled pool composing a library of displayed antibodies comprising CDR permutations and suitable for affinity interaction screening. Optionally, the shuffled pool is subjected to affinity screening to select shuffled library members which bind to a predetermined epitope (antigen) and thereby selecting a plurality of selected shuffled library members. Further, the plurality of selectively shuffled library members can be shuffled and screened iteratively, from 1 to about 1000 cycles or as desired until library members having a desired binding affinity are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0234">In another aspect of the invention, it is envisioned that prior to or during recombination or reassortment, polynucleotides generated by the method of the present invention can be subjected to agents or processes which promote the introduction of mutations into the original polynucleotides. The introduction of such mutations would increase the diversity of resulting hybrid polynucleotides and polypeptides encoded therefrom. The agents or processes which promote mutagenesis can include, but are not limited to: (+)-CC-1065, or a synthetic analog such as (+)-CC-1065-(N3-Adenine, see Sun and Hurley, 1992); an N-acelylated or deacetylated 4&#x2032;-fluro-4-aminobiphenyl adduct capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis (see, for example, van de Poll et al, 1992); or a N-acetylated or deacetylated 4-aminobiphenyl adduct capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis (see also, van de Poll et al, 1992, pp. 751-758); trivalent chromium, a trivalent chromium salt, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (&#x201c;PAH&#x201d;) DNA adduct capable of inhibiting DNA replication, such as 7-bromomethyl-benz[a]anthracene (&#x201c;BMA&#x201d;), tris(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate (&#x201c;Tris-BP&#x201d;), 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (&#x201c;DBCP&#x201d;), 2-bromoacrolein (2BA), benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9-10-epoxide (&#x201c;BPDE&#x201d;), a platinum(II) halogen salt, N-hydroxy-2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]-quinoline (&#x201c;N-hydroxy-IQ&#x201d;), and N-hydroxy-2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-f]-pyridine (&#x201c;N-hydroxy-PhIP&#x201d;). Especially preferred &#x201c;means for slowing or halting PCR amplification consist of UV light (+)-CC-1065 and (+)-CC-1065-(N3-Adenine). Particularly encompassed means are DNA adducts or polynucleotides comprising the DNA adducts from the polynucleotides or polynucleotides pool, which can be released or removed by a process including heating the solution comprising the polynucleotides prior to further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0235">In another aspect the present invention is directed to a method of producing recombinant proteins having biological activity by treating a sample comprising double-stranded template polynucleotides encoding a wild-type protein under conditions according to the present invention which provide for the production of hybrid or re-assorted polynucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0236">The invention also provides the use of polynucleotide shuffling to shuffle a population of viral genes (e.g., capsid proteins, spike glycoproteins, polymerases, and proteases) or viral genomes (e.g., paramyxoviridae, orthomyxoviridae, herpesviruses, retroviruses, reoviruses and rhinoviruses). In an embodiment, the invention provides a method for shuffling sequences encoding all or portions of immunogenic viral proteins to generate novel combinations of epitopes as well as novel epitopes created by recombination; such shuffled viral proteins may comprise epitopes or combinations of epitopes as well as novel epitopes created by recombination; such shuffled viral proteins may comprise epitopes or combinations of epitopes which are likely to arise in the natural environment as a consequence of viral evolution; (e.g., such as recombination of influenza virus strains).</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0237">The invention also provides a method suitable for shuffling polynucleotide sequences for generating gene therapy vectors and replication-defective gene therapy constructs, such as may be used for human gene therapy, including but not limited to vaccination vectors for DNA-based vaccination, as well as anti-neoplastic gene therapy and other general therapy formats.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0238">In the polypeptide notation used herein, the left-hand direction is the amino terminal direction and the right-hand direction is the carboxy-terminal direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention. Similarly, unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5&#x2032; end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5&#x2032; direction. The direction of 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5&#x2032; to the 5&#x2032; end of the RNA transcript are referred to as &#x201c;upstream sequences&#x201d;; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3&#x2032; to the 3&#x2032; end of the coding RNA transcript are referred to as &#x201c;downstream sequences&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Methodology</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0239">Nucleic acid shuffling is a method for in vitro or in vivo homologous recombination of pools of shorter or smaller polynucleotides to produce a polynucleotide or polynucleotides. Mixtures of related nucleic acid sequences or polynucleotides are subjected to sexual PCR to provide random polynucleotides, and reassembled to yield a library or mixed population of recombinant hybrid nucleic acid molecules or polynucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0240">In contrast to cassette mutagenesis, only shuffling and error-prone PCR allow one to mutate a pool of sequences blindly (without sequence information other than primers).</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0241">The advantage of the mutagenic shuffling of this invention over error-prone PCR alone for repeated selection can best be explained with an example from antibody engineering. Consider DNA shuffling as compared with error-prone PCR (not sexual PCR). The initial library of selected pooled sequences can consist of related sequences of diverse origin (i.e. antibodies from naive mRNA) or can be derived by any type of mutagenesis (including shuffling) of a single antibody gene. A collection of selected complementarity determining regions (&#x201c;CDRs&#x201d;) is obtained after the first round of affinity selection. <?delete-start id="REI-00022"  date="20150120" ?>In the diagram the thick<?delete-end id="REI-00022" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00023"  date="20150120" ?>The <?insert-end id="REI-00023" ?>CDRs confer onto the antibody molecule increased affinity for the antigen. Shuffling allows the free combinatorial association of all of the CDR1s with all of the CDR2s with all of the CDR3s, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0242">This method differs from error-prone PCR, in that it is an inverse chain reaction. In error-prone PCR, the number of polymerase start sites and the number of molecules grows exponentially. However, the sequence of the polymerase start sites and the sequence of the molecules remains essentially the same. In contrast, in nucleic acid reassembly or shuffling of random polynucleotides the number of start sites and the number (but not size) of the random polynucleotides decreases over time. For polynucleotides derived from whole plasmids the theoretical endpoint is a single, large concatemeric molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0243">Since cross-overs occur at regions of homology, recombination will primarily occur between members of the same sequence family. This discourages combinations of CDRs that are grossly incompatible (e.g., directed against different epitopes of the same antigen). It is contemplated that multiple families of sequences can be shuffled in the same reaction. Further, shuffling generally conserves the relative order, such that, for example, CDR1 will not be found in the position of CDR2.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0244">Rare shufflants will contain a large number of the best (eg. highest affinity) CDRs and these rare shufflants may be selected based on their superior affinity.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0245">CDRs from a pool of 100 different selected antibody sequences can be permutated in up to 100<sup>6 </sup>different ways. This large number of permutations cannot be represented in a single library of DNA sequences. Accordingly, it is contemplated that multiple cycles of DNA shuffling and selection may be required depending on the length of the sequence and the sequence diversity desired.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0246">Error-prone PCR, in contrast, keeps all the selected CDRs in the same relative sequence, generating a much smaller mutant cloud.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0247">The template polynucleotide which may be used in the methods of this invention may be DNA or RNA. It may be of various lengths depending on the size of the gene or shorter or smaller polynucleotide to be recombined or reassembled. Preferably, the template polynucleotide is from 50 by to 50 kb. It is contemplated that entire vectors containing the nucleic acid encoding the protein of interest can be used in the methods of this invention, and in fact have been successfully used.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0248">The template polynucleotide may be obtained by amplification using the PCR reaction (U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195) or other amplification or cloning methods. However, the removal of free primers from the PCR products before subjecting them to pooling of the PCR products and sexual PCR may provide more efficient results. Failure to adequately remove the primers from the original pool before sexual PCR can lead to a low frequency of crossover clones.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0249">The template polynucleotide often should be double-stranded. A double-stranded nucleic acid molecule is recommended to ensure that regions of the resulting single-stranded polynucleotides are complementary to each other and thus can hybridize to form a double-stranded molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0250">It is contemplated that single-stranded or double-stranded nucleic acid polynucleotides having regions of identity to the template polynucleotide and regions of heterology to the template polynucleotide may be added to the template polynucleotide, at this step. It is also contemplated that two different but related polynucleotide templates can be mixed at this step.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0251">The double-stranded polynucleotide template and any added double- or single-stranded polynucleotides are subjected to sexual PCR which includes slowing or halting to provide a mixture of from about 5 bp to 5 kb or more. Preferably the size of the random polynucleotides is from about 10 bp to 1000 bp, more preferably the size of the polynucleotides is from about 20 bp to 500 bp.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0252">Alternatively, it is also contemplated that double-stranded nucleic acid having multiple nicks may be used in the methods of this invention. A nick is a break in one strand of the double-stranded nucleic acid. The distance between such nicks is preferably 5 bp to 5 kb, more preferably between 10 bp to 1000 bp. This can provide areas of self-priming to produce shorter or smaller polynucleotides to be included with the polynucleotides resulting from random primers, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0253">The concentration of any one specific polynucleotide will not be greater than 1% by weight of the total polynucleotides, more preferably the concentration of any one specific nucleic acid sequence will not be greater than 0.1% by weight of the total nucleic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0254">The number of different specific polynucleotides in the mixture will be at least about 100, preferably at least about 500, and more preferably at least about 1000.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0255">At this step single-stranded or double-stranded polynucleotides, either synthetic or natural, may be added to the random double-stranded shorter or smaller polynucleotides in order to increase the heterogeneity of the mixture of polynucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0256">It is also contemplated that populations of double-stranded randomly broken polynucleotides may be mixed or combined at this step with the polynucleotides from the sexual PCR process and optionally subjected to one or more additional sexual PCR cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0257">Where insertion of mutations into the template polynucleotide is desired, single-stranded or double-stranded polynucleotides having a region of identity to the template polynucleotide and a region of heterology to the template polynucleotide may be added in a 20 fold excess by weight as compared to the total nucleic acid, more preferably the single-stranded polynucleotides may be added in a 10 fold excess by weight as compared to the total nucleic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0258">Where a mixture of different but related template polynucleotides is desired, populations of polynucleotides from each of the templates may be combined at a ratio of less than about 1:100, more preferably the ratio is less than about 1:40. For example, a backcross of the wild-type polynucleotide with a population of mutated polynucleotide may be desired to eliminate neutral mutations (e.g., mutations yielding an insubstantial alteration in the phenotypic property being selected for). In such an example, the ratio of randomly provided wild-type polynucleotides which may be added to the randomly provided sexual PCR cycle hybrid polynucleotides is approximately 1:1 to about 100:1, and more preferably from 1:1 to 40:1.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0259">The mixed population of random polynucleotides are denatured to form single-stranded polynucleotides and then re-annealed. Only those single-stranded polynucleotides having regions of homology with other single-stranded polynucleotides will re-anneal.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0260">The random polynucleotides may be denatured by heating. One skilled in the art could determine the conditions necessary to completely denature the double-stranded nucleic acid. Preferably the temperature is from 80&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C., more preferably the temperature is from 90&#xb0; C. to 96&#xb0; C. other methods which may be used to denature the polynucleotides include pressure (36) and pH.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0261">The polynucleotides may be re-annealed by cooling. Preferably the temperature is from 20&#xb0; C. to 75&#xb0; C., more preferably the temperature is from 40&#xb0; C. to 65&#xb0; C. If a high frequency of crossovers is needed based on an average of only 4 consecutive bases of homology, recombination can be forced by using a low annealing temperature, although the process becomes more difficult. The degree of renaturation which occurs will depend on the degree of homology between the population of single-stranded polynucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0262">Renaturation can be accelerated by the addition of polyethylene glycol (&#x201c;PEG&#x201d;) or salt. The salt concentration is preferably from 0 mM to 200 mM, more preferably the salt concentration is from 10 mM to 100 mm. The salt may be KCl or NaCl. The concentration of PEG is preferably from 0% to 20%, more preferably from 5% to 10%.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0263">The annealed polynucleotides are next incubated in the presence of a nucleic acid polymerase and dNTP's (i.e. dATP, dCTP, DGTP and dTTP). The nucleic acid polymerase may be the Klenow fragment, the Taq polymerase or any other DNA polymerase known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0264">The approach to be used for the assembly depends on the minimum degree of homology that should still yield cross-overs. If the areas of identity are large, Taq polymerase can be used with an annealing temperature of between 45-65&#xb0; C. If the areas of identity are small, Klenow polymerase can be used with an annealing temperature of between 20-30&#xb0; C. One skilled in the art could vary the temperature of annealing to increase the number of cross-overs achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0265">The polymerase may be added to the random polynucleotides prior to annealing, simultaneously with annealing or after annealing.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0266">The cycle of denaturation, renaturation and incubation in the presence of polymerase is referred to herein as shuffling or reassembly of the nucleic acid. This cycle is repeated for a desired number of times. Preferably the cycle is repeated from 2 to 50 times, more preferably the sequence is repeated from 10 to 40 times.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0267">The resulting nucleic acid is a larger double-stranded polynucleotide of from about 50 bp to about 100 kb, preferably the larger polynucleotide is from 500 bp to 50 kb.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0268">This larger polynucleotide may contain a number of copies of a polynucleotide having the same size as the template polynucleotide in tandem. This concatemeric polynucleotide is then denatured into single copies of the template polynucleotide. The result will be a population of polynucleotides of approximately the same size as the template polynucleotide. The population will be a mixed population where single or double-stranded polynucleotides having an area of identity and an area of heterology have been added to the template polynucleotide prior to shuffling.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0269">These polynucleotides are then cloned into the appropriate vector and the ligation mixture used to transform bacteria.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0270">It is contemplated that the single polynucleotides may be obtained from the larger concatemeric polynucleotide by amplification of the single polynucleotide prior to cloning by a variety of methods including PCR (U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202), rather than by digestion of the concatemer.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0271">The vector used for cloning is not critical provided that it will accept a polynucleotide of the desired size. If expression of the particular polynucleotide is desired, the cloning vehicle should further comprise transcription and translation signals next to the site of insertion of the polynucleotide to allow expression of the polynucleotide in the host cell. Preferred vectors include the pUC series and the pBR series of plasmids.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0272">The resulting bacterial population will include a number of recombinant polynucleotides having random mutations. This mixed population may be tested to identify the desired recombinant polynucleotides. The method of selection will depend on the polynucleotide desired.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0273">For example, if a polynucleotide which encodes a protein with increased binding efficiency to a ligand is desired, the proteins expressed by each of the portions of the polynucleotides in the population or library may be tested for their ability to bind to the ligand by methods known in the art (i.e. panning, affinity chromatography). If a polynucleotide which encodes for a protein with increased drug resistance is desired, the proteins expressed by each of the polynucleotides in the population or library may be tested for their ability to confer drug resistance to the host organism. One skilled in the art, given knowledge of the desired protein, could readily test the population to identify polynucleotides which confer the desired properties onto the protein.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0274">It is contemplated that one skilled in the art could use a phage display system in which fragments of the protein are expressed as fusion proteins on the phage surface (Pharmacia, Milwaukee Wis.). The recombinant DNA molecules are cloned into the phage DNA at a site which results in the transcription of a fusion protein a portion of which is encoded by the recombinant DNA molecule. The phage containing the recombinant nucleic acid molecule undergoes replication and transcription in the cell. The leader sequence of the fusion protein directs the transport of the fusion protein to the tip of the phage particle. Thus the fusion protein which is partially encoded by the recombinant DNA molecule is displayed on the phage particle for detection and selection by the methods described above.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0275">It is further contemplated that a number of cycles of nucleic acid shuffling may be conducted with polynucleotides from a sub-population of the first population, which sub-population contains DNA encoding the desired recombinant protein. In this manner, proteins with even higher binding affinities or enzymatic activity could be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0276">It is also contemplated that a number of cycles of nucleic acid shuffling may be conducted with a mixture of wild-type polynucleotides and a sub-population of nucleic acid from the first or subsequent rounds of nucleic acid shuffling in order to remove any silent mutations from the sub-population.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0277">Any source of nucleic acid, in purified form can be utilized as the starting nucleic acid. Thus the process may employ DNA or RNA including messenger RNA, which DNA or RNA may be single or double stranded. In addition, a DNA-RNA hybrid which contains one strand of each may be utilized. The nucleic acid sequence may be of various lengths depending on the size of the nucleic acid sequence to be mutated. Preferably the specific nucleic acid sequence is from 50 to 50000 base pairs. It is contemplated that entire vectors containing the nucleic acid encoding the protein of interest may be used in the methods of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0278">The nucleic acid may be obtained from any source, for example, from plasmids such a pBR322, from cloned DNA or RNA or from natural DNA or RNA from any source including bacteria, yeast, viruses and higher organisms such as plants or animals. DNA or RNA may be extracted from blood or tissue material. The template polynucleotide may be obtained by amplification using the polynucleotide chain reaction (PCR, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195). Alternatively, the polynucleotide may be present in a vector present in a cell and sufficient nucleic acid may be obtained by culturing the cell and extracting the nucleic acid from the cell by methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0279">Any specific nucleic acid sequence can be used to produce the population of hybrids by the present process. It is only necessary that a small population of hybrid sequences of the specific nucleic acid sequence exist or be created prior to the present process.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0280">The initial small population of the specific nucleic acid sequences having mutations may be created by a number of different methods. Mutations may be created by error-prone PCR. Error-prone PCR uses low-fidelity polymerization conditions to introduce a low level of point mutations randomly over a long sequence. Alternatively, mutations can be introduced into the template polynucleotide by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. In oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, a short sequence of the polynucleotide is removed from the polynucleotide using restriction enzyme digestion and is replaced with a synthetic polynucleotide in which various bases have been altered from the original sequence. The polynucleotide sequence can also be altered by chemical mutagenesis. Chemical mutagens include, for example, sodium bisulfite, nitrous acid, hydroxylamine, hydrazine or formic acid. other agents which are analogues of nucleotide precursors include nitrosoguanidine, 5-bromouracil, 2-aminopurine, or acridine. Generally, these agents are added to the PCR reaction in place of the nucleotide precursor thereby mutating the sequence. Intercalating agents such as proflavine, acriflavine, quinacrine and the like can also be used. Random mutagenesis of the polynucleotide sequence can also be achieved by irradiation with X-rays or ultraviolet light. Generally, plasmid polynucleotides so mutagenized are introduced into E. coli and propagated as a pool or library of hybrid plasmids.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0281">Alternatively the small mixed population of specific nucleic acids may be found in nature in that they may consist of different alleles of the same gene or the same gene from different related species (i.e., cognate genes). Alternatively, they may be related DNA sequences found within one species, for example, the immunoglobulin genes.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0282">Once the mixed population of the specific nucleic acid sequences is generated, the polynucleotides can be used directly or inserted into an appropriate cloning vector, using techniques well-known <?delete-start id="REI-00024"  date="20150120" ?>in,the<?delete-end id="REI-00024" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00025"  date="20150120" ?>in the <?insert-end id="REI-00025" ?>art.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0283">The choice of vector depends on the size of the polynucleotide sequence and the host cell to be employed in the methods of this invention. The templates of this invention may be plasmids, phages, cosmids, phagemids, viruses (e.g., retroviruses, parainfluenzavirus, herpesviruses, reoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and the like), or selected portions thereof (e.g., coat protein, spike glycoprotein, capsid protein). For example, cosmids and phagemids are preferred where the specific nucleic acid sequence to be mutated is larger because these vectors are able to stably propagate large polynucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0284">If the mixed population of the specific nucleic acid sequence is cloned into a vector it can be clonally amplified by inserting each vector into a host cell and allowing the host cell to amplify the vector. This is referred to as clonal amplification because while the absolute number of nucleic acid sequences increases, the number of hybrids does not increase. Utility can be readily determined by screening expressed polypeptides.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0285">The DNA shuffling method of this invention can be performed blindly on a pool of unknown sequences. By adding to the reassembly mixture oligonucleotides (with ends that are homologous to the sequences being reassembled) any sequence mixture can be incorporated at any specific position into another sequence mixture. Thus, it is contemplated that mixtures of synthetic oligonucleotides, PCR polynucleotides or even whole genes can be mixed into another <?delete-start id="REI-00026"  date="20150120" ?>sequence. library<?delete-end id="REI-00026" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00027"  date="20150120" ?>sequence library <?insert-end id="REI-00027" ?>at defined positions. The insertion of one sequence (mixture) is independent from the insertion of a sequence in another part of the template. Thus, the degree of recombination, the homology required, and the diversity of the library can be independently and simultaneously varied along the length of the reassembled DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0286">This approach of mixing two genes may be useful for the humanization of antibodies from murine hybridomas. The approach of mixing two genes or inserting alternative sequences into genes may be useful for any therapeutically used protein, for example, interleukin I, antibodies, tPA and growth hormone. The approach may also be useful in any nucleic acid for example, promoters or introns or 31 untranslated region or 51 untranslated regions of genes to increase expression or alter specificity of expression of proteins. The approach may also be used to mutate ribozymes or aptamers.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0287">Shuffling requires the presence of homologous regions separating regions of diversity. Scaffold-like protein structures may be particularly suitable for shuffling. The conserved scaffold determines the overall folding by self-association, while displaying relatively unrestricted loops that mediate the specific binding. Examples of such scaffolds are the immunoglobulin beta-barrel, and the four-helix bundle which are well-known in the art. This shuffling can be used to create scaffold-like proteins with various combinations of mutated sequences for binding.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Saturation Mutagenesis</heading>
<p id="p-0261" num="0288">In one aspect, this invention provides for the use of proprietary codon primers (containing a degenerate N,N,G/T sequence) to introduce point mutations into a polynucleotide, so as to generate a set of progeny polypeptides in which a full range of single amino acid substitutions is represented at each amino acid position. The oligos used are comprised contiguously of a first homologous sequence, a degenerate N,N,G/T sequence, and preferably but not necessarily a second homologous sequence. The downstream progeny translational products from the use of such oligos include all possible amino acid changes at each amino acid site along the polypeptide, because the degeneracy of the N,N,G/T sequence includes codons for all 20 amino acids.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0289">In one aspect, one such degenerate oligo (comprised of one degenerate N,N,G/T cassette) is used for subjecting each original codon in a parental polynucleotide template to a full range of codon substitutions. In another aspect, at least two degenerate N,N,G/T cassettes are used&#x2014;either in the same oligo or not, for subjecting at least two original codons in a parental polynucleotide template to a full range of codon substitutions. Thus, more than one N,N,G/T sequence can be contained in one oligo to introduce amino acid mutations at more than one site. This plurality of N,N,G/T sequences can be directly contiguous, or separated by one or more additional nucleotide sequence(s). In another aspect, oligos serviceable for introducing additions and deletions can be used either alone or in combination with the codons containing an N,N,G/T sequence, to introduce any combination or permutation of amino acid additions, deletions, and/or substitutions.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0290">In a particular exemplification, it is possible to simultaneously mutagenize two or more contiguous amino acid Positions using an oligo that contains contiguous N,N,G/T triplets, i.e. a degenerate (N,N,G/T)N sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0291">In another aspect, the present invention provides for the use of degenerate cassettes having less degeneracy than the N,N,G/T sequence. For example, it may be desirable in some instances to use (e.g. in an oligo) a degenerate triplet sequence comprised of only one N, where said N can be in the first second or third position of the triplet. Any other bases including any combinations and permutations thereof can be used in the remaining two positions of the triplet. Alternatively, it may be desirable in some instances to use (e.g. in an oligo) a degenerate N,N,N triplet sequence, or an N,N, G/C triplet sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0292">It is appreciated, however, that the use of a degenerate triplet (such as N,N,G/T or an N,N, G/C triplet sequence) as disclosed in the instant invention is advantageous for several reasons. In one aspect, this invention provides a means to systematically and fairly easily generate the substitution of the full range of possible amino acids (for a total of 20 amino acids) into each and every amino acid position in a polypeptide. Thus, for a 100 amino acid polypeptide, the instant invention provides a way to systematically and fairly easily generate 2000 distinct species (i.e. 20 possible amino acids per position&#xd7;100 amino acid positions). It is appreciated that there is provided, through the use of an oligo containing a degenerate N,N,G/T or an N,N, G/C triplet sequence, 32 individual sequences that code for 20 possible amino acids. Thus, in a reaction vessel in which a parental polynucleotide sequence is subjected to saturation mutagenesis using one such oligo, there are generated 32 distinct progeny polynucleotides encoding 20 distinct polypeptides. In contrast, the use of a non-degenerate oligo in site-directed mutagenesis leads to only one progeny polypeptide product per reaction vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0293">This invention also provides for the use of nondegenerate oligos, which can optionally be used in combination with degenerate primers disclosed. It is appreciated that in some situations, it is advantageous to use nondegenerate oligos to generate specific point mutations in a working polynucleotide. This provides a means to generate specific silent point mutations, point mutations leading to corresponding amino acid changes, and point mutations that cause the generation of stop codons and the corresponding expression of polypeptide fragments.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0294">Thus, in a preferred embodiment of this invention, each saturation mutagenesis reaction vessel contains polynucleotides encoding at least 20 progeny polypeptide molecules such that all 20 amino acids are represented at the one specific amino acid position corresponding to the codon position mutagenized in the parental polynucleotide. The 32-fold degenerate progeny polypeptides generated from each saturation mutagenesis reaction vessel can be subjected to clonal amplification (e.g. cloned into a suitable E. Coli host using an expression vector) and subjected to expression screening. When an individual progeny polypeptide is identified by screening to display a favorable change in property (when compared to the parental polypeptide), it can be sequenced to identify the correspondingly favorable amino acid substitution contained therein.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0295">It is appreciated that upon mutagenizing each and every amino acid position in a parental polypeptide using saturation mutagenesis as disclosed herein, favorable amino acid changes may be identified at more than one amino acid position. One or more new progeny molecules can be generated that contain a combination of all or part of these favorable amino acid substitutions. For example, if 2 specific favorable amino acid changes are identified in each of 3 amino acid positions in a polypeptide, the permutations include 3 possibilities at each position (no change from the original amino acid, and each of two favorable changes) and 3 positions. Thus, there are 3&#xd7;3&#xd7;3 or 27 total possibilities, including 7 that were previously examined &#x2014;6 single point mutations (i.e. 2 at each of three positions) and no change at any position.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0296">In yet another aspect, site-saturation mutagenesis can be used together with shuffling, chimerization, recombination and other mutagenizing processes, along with screening. This invention provides for the use of any mutagenizing process(es), including saturation mutagenesis, in an iterative manner. In one exemplification, the iterative use of any mutagenizing process(es) is used in combination with screening.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0297">Thus, in a non-limiting exemplification, this invention provides for the use of saturation mutagenesis in combination with additional mutagenization processes, such as a process where two or more related polynucleotides are introduced into a suitable host cell such that a hybrid polynucleotide is generated by recombination and reductive reassortment.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0298">In addition to performing mutagenesis along the entire sequence of a gene, the instant invention provides that mutagenesis can be use to replace each of any number of bases in a polynucleotide sequence, wherein the number of bases to be mutagenized is preferably every integer from 15 to 100,000. Thus, instead of mutagenizing every position along a molecule, one can subject every a discrete number of bases (preferably a subset totaling from 15 to 100,000) to mutagenesis. Preferably, a separate nucleotide is used for mutagenizing each position or group of positions along a polynucleotide sequence. A group of 3 positions to be mutagenized may be a codon. The mutations are preferably introduced using a mutagenic primer, containing a heterologous cassette, also referred to as a mutagenic cassette. Preferred cassettes can have from 1 to 500 bases. Each nucleotide position in such heterologous cassettes be N, A, C, G, T, A/C, NG, A/T, C/G, G/T, C/G/T, A/G/T, A/C/T, A/C/G, or E, where E is any base that is not A, C, G, or T (E can be referred to as a designer oligo). The tables below show exemplary tri-nucleotide cassettes (there are over 3000 possibilities in addition to N,N,G/T and N,N,N and N,N,A/C).</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0299">In a general sense, saturation mutagenesis is comprised of mutagenizing a complete set of mutagenic cassettes (wherein each cassette is preferably 1-500 bases in length) in defined polynucleotide sequence to be mutagenized (wherein the sequence to be mutagenized is preferably from 15 to 100,000 bases in length). Thusly, a group of mutations (ranging from 1 to 100 mutations) is introduced into each cassette to be mutagenized. A grouping of mutations to be introduced into one cassette can be different or the same from a second grouping of mutations to be introduced into a second cassette during the application of one round of saturation mutagenesis. Such groupings are exemplified by deletions, additions, groupings of particular codons, and groupings of particular nucleotide cassettes.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0300">Defined sequences to be mutagenized (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) include preferably a whole gene, pathway, cDNA, an entire open reading frame (ORF), and intire promoter, enhancer, repressor/transactivator, origin of replication, intron, operator, or any polynucleotide functional group. Generally, a preferred &#x201c;defined sequences&#x201d; for this purpose may be any polynucleotide that a 15 base-polynucleotide sequence, and polynucleotide sequences of lengths between 15 bases and 15,000 bases (this invention specifically names every integer in between). Considerations in choosing groupings of codons include types of amino acids encoded by a degenerate mutagenic cassette.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0301">In a particularly preferred exemplification a grouping of mutations that can be introduced into a mutagenic cassette, this invention specifically provides for degenerate codon substitutions (using degenerate oligos) that code for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 amino acids at each position, and a library of polypeptides encoded thereby.</p>

<p id="h-0012" num="0000">In vitro Shuffling</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0302">The equivalents of some standard genetic matings may also be performed by shuffling in vitro. For example, a &#x201c;molecular backcross&#x201d; can be performed by repeatedly mixing the hybrid's nucleic acid with the wild-type nucleic acid while selecting for the mutations of interest. As in traditional breeding, this approach can be used to combine phenotypes from different sources into a background of choice. It is useful, for example, for the removal of neutral mutations that affect unselected characteristics (i.e. immunogenicity). Thus it can be useful to determine which mutations in a protein are involved in the enhanced biological activity and which are not, an advantage which cannot be achieved by error-prone mutagenesis or cassette mutagenesis methods.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0303">Large, functional genes can be assembled correctly from a mixture of small random polynucleotides. This reaction may be of use for the reassembly of genes from the highly fragmented DNA of fossils. In addition random nucleic acid fragments from fossils may be combined with polynucleotides from similar genes from related species.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0304">It is also contemplated that the method of this invention can be used for the in vitro amplification of a whole genome from a single cell as is needed for a variety of research and diagnostic applications. DNA amplification by PCR is in practice limited to a length of about 40 kb. Amplification of a whole genome such as that of E. coli (5,000 kb) by PCR would require about 250 primers yielding 125 forty kb polynucleotides. This approach is not practical due to the unavailability of sufficient sequence data. On the other hand, random production of polynucleotides of the genome with sexual PCR cycles, followed by gel purification of small polynucleotides will provide a multitude of possible primers. Use of this mix of random small polynucleotides as primers in a PCR reaction alone or with the whole genome as the template should result in an inverse chain reaction with the theoretical endpoint of a single concatamer containing many copies of the genome.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0305">100 fold amplification in the copy number and an average polynucleotide size of greater than 50 kb may be obtained when only random polynucleotides are used. It is thought that the larger concatamer is generated by overlap of many smaller polynucleotides. The quality of specific PCR products obtained using synthetic primers will be indistinguishable from the product obtained from unamplified DNA. It is expected that this approach will be useful for the mapping of genomes.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0306">The polynucleotide to be shuffled can be produced as random or non-random polynucleotides, at the discretion of the practitioner. Moreover, this invention provides a method of shuffling that is applicable to a wide range of polynucleotide sizes and types, including the step of generating polynucleotide monomers to be used as building blocks in the reassembly of a larger polynucleotide. For example, the building blocks can be fragments of genes or they can be comprised of entire genes or gene pathways, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Exonuclease-mediated Shuffling</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0307">In a particular embodiment, this invention provides for a method for shuffling, assembling, reassembling, recombining, &#x26;/or concatenating at least two polynucleotides to form a progeny polynucleotide (e.g. a chimeric progeny polynucleotide that can be expressed to produce a polypeptide or a gene pathway). In a particular embodiment, a double stranded polynucleotide end (e.g. two single stranded sequences hybridized to each other as hybridization partners) is treated with an exonuclease to liberate nucleotides from one of the two strands, leaving the remaining strand free of its original partner so that, if desired, the remaining strand may be used to achieve hybridization to another partner.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0308">In a particular aspect, a double stranded polynucleotide end (that may be part of&#x2014;or connected to&#x2014;a polynucleotide or a nonpolynucleotide sequence) is subjected to a source of exonuclease activity. Serviceable sources of exonuclease activity may be an enzyme with 3&#x2032; exonuclease activity, an enzyme with 5&#x2032; exonuclease activity, an enzyme with both 3&#x2032; exonuclease activity and 5&#x2032; exonuclease activity, and any combination thereof. An exonuclease can be used to liberate nucleotides from one or both ends of a linear double stranded polynucleotide, and from one to all ends of a branched polynucleotide having more than two ends. The mechanism of action of this liberation is believed to be comprised of an enzymatically-catalyzed hydrolysis of terminal nucleotides, and can be allowed to proceed in a time-dependent fashion, allowing experimental control of the progression of the enzymatic process.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0309">By contrast, a non-enzymatic step may be used to shuffle, assemble, reassemble, recombine, and/or concatenate polynucleotide building blocks that is comprised of subjecting a working sample to denaturing (or &#x201c;melting&#x201d;) conditions (for example, by changing temperature, pH, and /or salinity conditions) so as to melt a working set of double stranded polynucleotides into single polynucleotide strands. For shuffling, it is desirable that the single polynucleotide strands participate to some extent in annealment with different hybridization partners (i.e. and not merely revert to exclusive reannealment between what were former partners before the denaturation step). The presence of the former hybridization partners in the reaction vessel, however, does not preclude, and may sometimes even favor, reannealment of a single stranded polynucleotide with its former partner, to recreate an original double stranded polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0310">In contrast to this non-enzymatic shuffling step comprised of subjecting double stranded polynucleotide building blocks to denaturation, followed by annealment, the instant invention further provides an exonuclease-based approach requiring no denaturation&#x2014;rather, the avoidance of denaturing conditions and the maintenance of double stranded polynucleotide substrates in annealed (i.e. non-denatured) state are necessary conditions for the action of exonucleases (e.g., exonuclease III and red alpha gene product). Additionally in contrast, the generation of single stranded polynucleotide sequences capable of hybridizing to other single stranded polynucleotide sequences is the result of covalent cleavage&#x2014;and hence sequence destruction&#x2014;in one of the hybridization partners. For example, an exonuclease III enzyme may be used to enzymatically liberate 3&#x2032; terminal nucleotides in one hybridization strand (to achieve covalent hydrolysis in that polynucleotide strand); and this favors hybridization of the remaining single strand to a new partner (since its former partner was subjected to covalent cleavage).</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0311">By way of further illustration, a specific exonuclease, namely exonuclease III is provided herein as an example of a 3&#x2032; exonuclease; however, other exonucleases may also be used, including enzymes with 5&#x2032; exonuclease activity and enzymes with 3&#x2032; exonuclease activity, and including enzymes not yet discovered and enzymes not yet developed. It is particularly appreciated that enzymes can be discovered, optimized (e.g. engineered by directed evolution), or both discovered and optimized specifically for the instantly disclosed approach that have more optimal rates &#x26;/or more highly specific activities &#x26;/or greater lack of unwanted activities. In fact it is expected that the instant invention may encourage the discovery &#x26;/or development of such designer enzymes. In sum, this invention may be practiced with a variety of currently available exonuclease enzymes, as well as enzymes not yet discovered and enzymes not yet developed.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0312">The exonuclease action of exonuclease III requires a working double stranded polynucleotide end that is either blunt or has a 5&#x2032; overhang, and the exonuclease action is comprised of enzymatically liberating 3&#x2032; terminal nucleotides, leaving a single stranded 5&#x2032; end that becomes longer and longer as the exonuclease action proceeds (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Any 5&#x2032; overhangs produced by this approach may be used to hybridize to another single stranded polynucleotide sequence (which may also be a single stranded polynucleotide or a terminal overhang of a partially double stranded polynucleotide) that shares enough homology to allow hybridization. The ability of these exonuclease III-generated single stranded sequences (e.g. in 5&#x2032; overhangs) to hybridize to other single stranded sequences allows two or more polynucleotides to be shuffled, assembled, reassembled, &#x26;/or concatenated.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0313">Furthermore, it is appreciated that one can protect the end of a double stranded polynucleotide or render it susceptible to a desired enzymatic action of a serviceable exonuclease as necessary. For example, a double stranded polynucleotide end having a 3&#x2032; overhang is not susceptible to the exonuclease action of exonuclease III. However, it may be rendered susceptible to the exonuclease action of exonuclease III by a variety of means; for example, it may be blunted by treatment with a polymerase, cleaved to provide a blunt end or a 5&#x2032; overhang, joined (ligated or hybridized) to another double stranded polynucleotide to provide a blunt end or a 5&#x2032; overhang, hybridized to a single stranded polynucleotide to provide a blunt end or a 5&#x2032; overhang, or modified by any of a variety of means).</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0314">According to one aspect, an exonuclease may be allowed to act on one or on both ends of a linear double stranded polynucleotide and proceed to completion, to near completion, or to partial completion. When the exonuclease action is allowed to go to completion, the result will be that the length of each 5&#x2032; overhang will be extended far towards the middle region of the polynucleotide in the direction of what might be considered a &#x201c;rendezvous point&#x201d; (which may be somewhere near the polynucleotide midpoint). Ultimately, this results in the production of single stranded polynucleotides (that can become dissociated) that are each about half the length of the original double stranded polynucleotide (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Alternatively, an exonuclease-mediated reaction can be terminated before proceeding to completion.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0315">Thus this exonuclease-mediated approach is serviceable for shuffling, assembling &#x26;/or reassembling, recombining, and concatenating polynucleotide building blocks, which polynucleotide building blocks can be up to ten bases long or tens of bases long or hundreds of bases long or thousands of bases long or tens of thousands of bases long or hundreds of thousands of bases long or millions of bases long or even longer.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0316">This exonuclease-mediated approach is based on the action of double stranded DNA specific exodeoxyribonuclease activity of E. coli exonuclease III. Substrates for exonuclease III may be generated by subjecting a double stranded polynucleotide to fragmentation. Fragmentation may be achieved by mechanical means (e.g., shearing, sonication, etc.), by enzymatic means (e.g. using restriction enzymes), and by any combination thereof. Fragments of a larger polynucleotide may also be generated by polymerase-mediated synthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0317">Exonuclease III is a 28K monomeric enzyme, product of the xthA gene of E. Coli with four known activities: exodeoxyribonuclease (alternatively referred to as exonuclease herein), RNaseH, DNA-3&#x2032;-phosphatase, and AP endonuclease. The exodeoxyribonuclease activity is specific for double stranded DNA. The mechanism of action is thought to involve enzymatic hydrolysis of DNA from a 3&#x2032; end progressively towards a 5&#x2032; direction, with formation of nucleoside 5&#x2032;-phosphates and a residual single strand. The enzyme does not display efficient hydrolysis of single stranded DNA, single-stranded RNA, or double-stranded RNA; however it degrades RNA in an DNA-RNA hybrid releasing nucleoside 5&#x2032;-phosphates. The enzyme also releases inorganic phosphate specifically from 3&#x2032;phosphomonoester groups on DNA, but not from RNA or short oligonucleotides. Removal of these groups converts the terminus into a primer for DNA polymerase action.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0318">Additional examples of enzymes with exonuclease activity include red-alpha and venom phosphodiesterases. Red alpha (red&#x3b1;) gene product (also referred to as lambda exonuclease) is of bacteriophage &#x3bb; origin. The reds gene is transcribed from the leftward promoter and its product is involved (24 kD) in recombination. Red alpha gene product acts processively from 5&#x2032;-phosphorylated termini to liberate mononucleotides from duplex DNA (Takahashi &#x26; Kobayashi, 1990). Venom phosphodiesterases (Laskowski, 1980) is capable of rapidly opening supercoiled DNA.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Synthetic Ligation Reassembly</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0319">In one aspect, the present invention provides a non-stochastic method termed synthetic ligation reassembly (SLR), that is somewhat related to stochastic shuffling, save that the nucleic acid building blocks are not shuffled or concatenated or chimerized randomly, but rather are assembled non-stochastically.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0320">A particularly glaring difference is that the instant SLR method does not depend on the presence of a high level of homology between polynucleotides to be shuffled. In contrast, prior methods, particularly prior stochastic shuffling methods require that presence of a high level of homology, particularly at coupling sites, between polynucleotides to be shuffled. Accordingly these prior methods favor the regeneration of the original progenitor molecules, and are suboptimal for generating, large numbers of novel progeny chimeras, particularly full-length progenies. The instant invention, on the other hand, can be used to non-stochastically generate libraries (or sets) of progeny molecules comprised of over 10<sup>100 </sup>different chimeras. Conceivably, SLR can even be used to generate libraries comprised of over 10<sup>1000 </sup>different progeny chimeras with (no upper limit in sight).</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0321">Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides a method, which method is non-stochastic, of producing a set of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules having an overall assembly order that is chosen by design, which method is comprised of the steps of generating by design a plurality of specific nucleic acid building blocks having serviceable mutually compatible ligatable ends, and assembling these nucleic acid building blocks, such that a designed overall assembly order is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0322">The mutually compatible ligatable ends of the nucleic acid building blocks to be assembled are considered to be &#x201c;serviceable&#x201d; for this type of ordered assembly if they enable the building blocks to be coupled in predetermined orders. Thus, in one aspect, the overall assembly order in which the nucleic acid building blocks can be coupled is specified by the design of the ligatable ends and, if more than one assembly step is to be used, then the overall assembly order in which the nucleic acid building blocks can be coupled is also specified by the sequential order of the assembly step(s). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, Panel C illustrates an exemplary assembly process comprised of 2 sequential steps to achieve a designed (non-stochastic) overall assembly order for five nucleic acid building blocks. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the annealed building pieces are treated with an enzyme, such as a ligase (e.g. T4 DNA ligase), achieve covalent bonding of the building pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0323">In a preferred embodiment, the design of nucleic acid building blocks is obtained upon analysis of the sequences of a set of progenitor nucleic acid templates that serve as a basis for producing a progeny set of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules. These progenitor nucleic acid templates thus serve as a source of sequence information that aids in the design of the nucleic acid building blocks that are to be mutagenized; i.e. chimerized or shuffled.</p>

<p id="p-0298" num="0404">These exemplifications, while illustrating certain specific aspects of the invention, do not portray the limitations or circumscribe the scope of the disclosed invention.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0405">Thus according to one aspect of this invention, the sequences of a plurality of progenitor nucleic acid templates are aligned in order to select one or more demarcation points, which demarcation points can be located at an area of homology, and are comprised of one or more nucleotides, and which demarcation points are shared by at least two of the progenitor templates. The demarcation points can be used to delineate the boundaries of nucleic acid building blocks to be generated. Thus, the demarcation points identified and selected in the progenitor molecules serve as potential chimerization points in the assembly of the progeny molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0406">Preferably a serviceable demarcation point is an area of homology (comprised of at least one homologous nucleotide base) shared by at least two progenitor templates. More preferably a serviceable demarcation point is an area of homology that is shared by at least half of the progenitor templates. More preferably still a serviceable demarcation point is an area of homology that is shared by at least two thirds of the progenitor templates. Even more preferably a serviceable demarcation points is an area of homology that is shared by at least three fourths of the progenitor templates. Even more preferably still a serviceable demarcation points is an area of homology that is shared by at almost all of the progenitor templates. Even more preferably still a serviceable demarcation point is an area of homology that is shared by all of the progenitor templates.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0407">The process of designing nucleic acid building blocks and of designing the mutually compatible ligatable ends of the nucleic acid building blocks to be assembled is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. As shown, the alignment of a set of progenitor templates reveals several naturally occurring demarcation points, and the identification of demarcation points shared by these templates helps to non-stochastically determine the building blocks to be generated and used for the generation of the progeny chimeric molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0408">In a preferred embodiment, this invention provides that the ligation reassembly process is performed exhaustively in order to generate an exhaustive library. In other words, all possible ordered combinations of the nucleic acid building blocks are represented in the set of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules. At the same time, in a particularly preferred embodiment, the assembly order (i.e. the order of assembly of each building block in the 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; sequence of each finalized chimeric nucleic acid) in each combination is by design (or non-stochastic). Because of the non-stochastic nature of this invention, the possibility of unwanted side products is greatly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0409">In another preferred embodiment, this invention provides that, the ligation reassembly process is performed systematically, for example in order to generate a systematically compartmentalized library, with compartments that can be screened systematically, e.g. one by one. In other words this invention provides that, through the selective and judicious use of specific nucleic acid building blocks, coupled with the selective and judicious use of sequentially stepped assembly reactions, an experimental design can be achieved where specific sets of progeny products are made in each of several reaction vessels. This allows a systematic examination and screening procedure to be performed. Thus, it allows a potentially very large number of progeny molecules to be examined systematically in smaller groups.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0410">Because of its ability to perform chimerizations in a manner that is highly flexible yet exhaustive and systematic as well, particularly when there is a low level of homology among the progenitor molecules, the instant invention provides for the generation of a library (or set) comprised of a large number of progeny molecules. Because of the non-stochastic nature of the instant ligation reassembly invention, the progeny molecules generated preferably comprise a library of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules having an overall assembly order that is chosen by design. In a particularly preferred embodiment of this invention, such a generated library is comprised of preferably greater than 10<sup>3 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably greater than 10<sup>5 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>10 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>15 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>20 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>30 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>40 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>50 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>60 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>70 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>80 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>100 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>110 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>120 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>130 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>140 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>150 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>175 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>200 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>300 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>400 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>500 </sup>different progeny molecular species, and even more preferably still greater than 10<sup>1000 </sup>different progeny molecular species.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0411">In one aspect, a set of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules, produced as described is comprised of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide. According to one preferred embodiment, this polynucleotide is a gene, which may be a man-made gene. According to another preferred embodiment, this polynucleotide is a gene pathway, which may be a man-made gene pathway. This invention provides that one or more man-made genes generated by this invention may be incorporated into a man-made gene pathway, such as pathway operable in a eukaryotic organism (including a plant).</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0412">It is appreciated that the power of this invention is exceptional, as there is much freedom of choice and control regarding the selection of demarcation points, the size and number of the nucleic acid building blocks, and the size and design of the couplings. It is appreciated, furthermore, that the requirement for intermolecular homology is highly relaxed for the operability of this invention. In fact, demarcation points can even be chosen in areas of little or no intermolecular homology. For example, because of codon wobble, i.e. the degeneracy of codons, nucleotide substitutions can be introduced into nucleic acid building blocks without altering the amino acid originally encoded in the corresponding progenitor template. Alternatively, a codon can be altered such that the coding for an originally amino acid is altered. This invention provides that such substitutions can be introduced into the nucleic acid building block in order to increase the incidence of intermolecularly homologous demarcation points and thus to allow an increased number of couplings to be achieved among the building blocks, which in turn allows a greater number of progeny chimeric molecules to be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0413">In another exemplification, the synthetic nature of the step in which the building blocks are generated allows the design and introduction of nucleotides (e.g. one or more nucleotides, which may be, for example, codons or introns or regulatory sequences) that can later be optionally removed in an in vitro process (e.g. by <?delete-start id="REI-00028"  date="20150120" ?>mutageneis<?delete-end id="REI-00028" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00029"  date="20150120" ?>mutagenesis<?insert-end id="REI-00029" ?>) or in an in vivo process (e.g. by utilizing the gene splicing ability of a host organism). It is appreciated that in many instances the introduction of these nucleotides may also be desirable for many other reasons in addition to the potential benefit of creating a serviceable demarcation point.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0414">Thus, according to another embodiment, this invention provides that a nucleic acid building block can be used to introduce an intron. Thus, this invention provides that functional introns may be introduced into a man-made gene of this invention. This invention also provides that functional introns may be introduced into a man-made gene pathway of this invention. Accordingly, this invention provides for the generation of a chimeric polynucleotide that is a man-made gene containing one (or more) artificially introduced intron(s).</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0415">Accordingly, this invention also provides for the generation of a chimeric polynucleotide that is a man-made gene pathway containing one (or more) artificially introduced intron(s). Preferably, the artificially introduced intron(s) are functional in one or more host cells for gene splicing much in the way that naturally-occurring introns serve functionally in gene splicing. This invention provides a process of producing man-made intron-containing polynucleotides to be introduced into host organisms for recombination and/or splicing.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0416">The ability to achieve chimerizations, using couplings as described herein, in areas of little or no homology among the progenitor molecules, is particularly useful, and in fact critical, for the assembly of novel gene pathways. This invention thus provides for the generation of novel man-made gene pathways using synthetic ligation reassembly. In a particular aspect, this is achieved by the introduction of regulatory sequences, such as promoters, that are operable in an intended host, to confer operability to a novel gene pathway when it is introduced into the intended host. In a particular exemplification, this invention provides for the generation of novel man-made gene pathways that is operable in a plurality of intended hosts (e.g. in a microbial organism as well as in a plant cell). This can be achieve, for example, by the introduction of a plurality of regulatory sequences, comprised of a regulatory sequence that is operable in a first intended host and a regulatory sequence that is operable in a second intended host. A similar process can be performed to achieve operability of a gene pathway in a third intended host species, etc. The number of intended host species can be each integer from 1 to 10 or alternatively over 10. Alternatively, for example, operability of a gene pathway in a plurality of intended hosts can be achieved by the introduction of a regulatory sequence having intrinsic operability in a plurality of intended hosts.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0417">Thus, according to a particular embodiment, this invention provides that a nucleic acid building block can be used to introduce a regulatory sequence, particularly a regulatory sequence for gene expression. Preferred regulatory sequences include, but are not limited to, those that are man-made, and those found in archeal, bacterial, eukaryotic (including mitochondrial), viral, and prionic or prion-like organisms. Preferred regulatory sequences include but are not limited to, promoters, operators, and activator binding sites. Thus, this invention provides that functional regulatory sequences may be introduced into a man-made gene of this invention. This invention also provides that functional regulatory sequences may be introduced into a man-made gene pathway of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0418">Accordingly, this invention provides for the generation of a chimeric polynucleotide that is a man-made gene containing one (or more) artificially introduced regulatory sequence(s). Accordingly, this invention also provides for the generation of a chimeric polynucleotide that is a man-made gene pathway containing one (or more) artificially introduced regulatory sequence(s). Preferably, an artificially introduced regulatory sequence(s) is operatively linked to one or more genes in the man-made polynucleotide, and are functional in one or more host cells.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0419">Preferred bacterial promoters that are serviceable for this invention include lacI, lacZ, T3, T7, gpt, lambda P<sub>R</sub>, P<sub>L </sub>and trp. Serviceable eukaryotic promoters include CMV immediate early, HSV thymidine kinase, early and late SV40, LTRs from retrovirus, and mouse metallothionein-I. Particular plant regulatory sequences include promoters active in directing transcription in plants, either constitutively or stage and/or tissue specific, depending on the use of the plant or parts thereof. These promoters include, but are not limited to promoters showing constitutive expression, such as the 35S promoter of Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) (Guilley et al., 1982), those for leaf-specific expression, such as the promoter of the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit gene (Coruzzi et al., 1984), those for root-specific expression, such as the promoter from the glutamin synthase gene (Tingey et al., 1987), those for seed-specific expression, such as the cruciferin A promoter from Brassica napus (Ryan et al., 1989), those for tuber-specific expression, such as the class-I patatin promoter from potato (Rocha-Sasa et al., 1989; Wenzler et al., 1989) or those for fruit-specific expression, such as the polygalacturonase (PG) promoter from tomato (Bird et al., 1988).</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0420">Other regulatory sequences that are preferred for this invention include terminator sequences and polyadenylation signals and any such sequence functioning as such in plants, the choice of which is within the level of the skilled artisan. An example of such sequences is the 3&#x2032; flanking region of the nopaline synthase (nos) gene of Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Bevan, 1984). The regulatory sequences may also include enhancer sequences, such as found in the 35S promoter of CaMV, and mRNA stabilizing sequences such as the leader sequence of Alfalfa Mosaic Cirus (A1MV) RNA4 (Brederode et al., 1980) or any other sequences functioning in a like manner.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0421">A man-made genes produced using this invention can also serve as a substrate for recombination with another nucleic acid. Likewise, a man-made gene pathway produced using this invention can also serve as a substrate for recombination with another nucleic acid. In a preferred instance, the recombination is facilitated by, or occurs at, areas of homology between the man-made intron-containing gene and a nucleic acid with serves as a recombination partner. In a particularly preferred instance, the recombination partner may also be a nucleic acid generated by this invention, including a man-made gene or a man-made gene pathway. Recombination may be facilitated by or may occur at areas of homology that exist at the one (or more) artificially introduced intron(s) in the man-made gene.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0422">The synthetic ligation reassembly method of this invention utilizes a plurality of nucleic acid building blocks, each of which preferably has two ligat able ends. The two ligatable ends on each nucleic acid building block may be two blunt ends (i.e. each having an overhang of zero nucleotides), or preferably one blunt end and one overhang, or more preferably still two overhangs.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0423">A serviceable overhang for this purpose may be a 3&#x2032; overhang or a 5&#x2032; overhang. Thus, a nucleic acid building block may have a 3&#x2032; overhang or alternatively a 5&#x2032; overhang or alternatively two 3&#x2032; overhangs or alternatively two 5&#x2032; overhangs. The overall order in which the nucleic acid building blocks are assembled to form a finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecule is determined by purposeful experimental design and is not random.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0424">According to one preferred embodiment, a nucleic acid building block is generated by chemical synthesis of two single-stranded nucleic acids (also referred to as single-stranded oligos) and contacting them so as to allow them to anneal to form a double-stranded nucleic acid building block.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0425">A double-stranded nucleic acid building block can be of variable size. The sizes of these building blocks can be small or large depending on the choice of the experimenter. Preferred sizes for building block range from 1 base pair (not including any overhangs) to 100,000 base pairs (not including any overhangs). Other preferred size ranges are also provided, which have lower limits of from 1 bp to 10,000 bp (including every integer value in between), and upper limits of from 2 bp to 100, 000 bp (including every integer value in between).</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0426">It is appreciated that current methods of polymerase-based amplification can be used to generate double-stranded nucleic acids of up to thousands of base pairs, if not tens of thousands of base pairs, in length with high fidelity. Chemical synthesis (e.g. phosphoramidite-based) can be used to generate nucleic acids of up to hundreds of nucleotides in length with high fidelity; however, these can be assembled, e.g. using overhangs or sticky ends, to form double-stranded nucleic acids of up to thousands of base pairs, if not tens of thousands of base pairs, in length if so desired.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0427">A combination of methods (e.g. phosphoramidite-based chemical synthesis and PCR) can also be used according to this invention. Thus, nucleic acid building block made by different methods can also be used in combination to generate a progeny molecule of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0428">The use of chemical synthesis to generate nucleic acid building blocks is particularly preferred in this invention &#x26; is advantageous for other reasons as well, including procedural safety and ease. No cloning or harvesting or actual handling of any biological samples is required. The design of the nucleic acid building blocks can be accomplished on paper. Accordingly, this invention teaches an advance in procedural safety in recombinant technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0429">Nonetheless, according to one preferred embodiment, a double-stranded nucleic acid building block according to this invention may also be generated by polymerase-based amplification of a polynucleotide template. In a non-limiting exemplification, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a first polymerase-based amplification reaction using a first set of primers, F<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>1</sub>, is used to generate a blunt-ended product (labeled Reaction 1, Product 1), which is essentially identical to Product A. A second polymerase-based amplification reaction using a second set of primers, F<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2</sub>, is used to generate a blunt-ended product (labeled Reaction 2, Product 2), which is essentially identical to Product B. These two products are mixed and allowed to melt and anneal, generating potentially useful double-stranded nucleic acid building blocks with two overhangs. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the product with the 3&#x2032; overhangs (Product C) is selected by nuclease-based degradation of the other 3 products using a 3&#x2032; acting exonuclease, such as exonuclease III. It is appreciated that a 5&#x2032; acting exonuclease (e.g. red alpha) may be also be used, for example to select Product D instead. It is also appreciated that other selection means can also be used, including hybridization-based means, and that these means can incorporate a further means, such as a magnetic bead-based means, to facilitate separation of the desired product.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0430">Many other methods exist by which a double-stranded nucleic acid building block can be generated that is serviceable for this invention; and these are known in the art and can be readily performed by the skilled artisan.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0431">According to particularly preferred embodiment, a double-stranded nucleic acid building block that is serviceable for this invention is generated by first generating two single stranded nucleic acids and allowing them to anneal to form a double-stranded nucleic acid building block. The two strands of a double-stranded nucleic acid building block may be complementary at every nucleotide apart from any that form an overhang; thus containing no mismatches, apart from any overhang(s). According to another embodiment, the two strands of a double-stranded nucleic acid building block are complementary at fewer than every nucleotide apart from any that form an overhang. Thus, according to this embodiment, a double-stranded nucleic acid building block can be used to introduce codon degeneracy. Preferably the codon degeneracy is introduced using the site-saturation mutagenesis described herein, using one or more N,N,G/T cassettes or alternatively using one or more N,N,N cassettes.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0432">Contained within an exemplary experimental design for achieving an ordered assembly according to this invention are:

<p id="p-0327" num="0436">An overhang may be a 3&#x2032; overhang or a 5&#x2032; overhang. An overhang may also have a terminal phosphate group or alternatively may be devoid of a terminal phosphate group (having, e.g., a hydroxyl group instead). An overhang may be comprised of any number of nucleotides. Preferably an overhang is comprised of 0 nucleotides (as in a blunt end) to 10,000 nucleotides. Thus, a wide range of overhang sizes may be serviceable. Accordingly, the lower limit may be each integer from 1-200 and the upper limit may be each integer from 2-10,000. According to a particular exemplification, an overhang may consist of anywhere from 1 nucleotide to 200 nucleotides (including every integer value in between).</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0437">The final chimeric nucleic acid molecule may be generated by sequentially assembling 2 or more building blocks at a time until all the designated building blocks have been assembled. A working sample may optionally be subjected to a process for size selection or purification or other selection or enrichment process between the performance of two assembly steps. Alternatively, the final chimeric nucleic acid molecule may be generated by assembling all the designated building blocks at once in one step.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0438">The methods of these experiments allow reassembly to occur among nucleic acids having a little or no homology. Additionally fusion points or couplings can also occur in regions of low or no homology. The number of resulting molecules that can be generated in according to this experiment is very large.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0439">Rather than to physically generate and screen this large number of potential products in random order, it is appreciated that, optionally with the aid of a computer, groupings of these potential products can be non-stochastically determined and furthermore ranked according to the predicted the likelihood that desirable products are contained in each grouping. Accordingly it is appreciated according to this experiment that computer modeling (&#x201c;in silico&#x201d;) or mental calculations or considerations (&#x201c;in cranio&#x201d;) may be useful to determine groupings all of potential reassembly products, where each such grouping is delineated by the potential products that can be generated using one set (or a finite set) of reagents and/or resulting from a one application (or a finite number of applications) of a method (or a finite as number of methods) disclosed herein. Additionally the groupings can be ranked against each other mentally or using computer modeling by predicting the number of potentially desirable or usable products in each grouping.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0440">The grouping of potential products and the ranking of the groupings are different facets of what is referred to herein as &#x201c;triaging&#x201d;, and specifically &#x201c;in silico triage&#x201d; if performed using the aid of a computer.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0441">Examples of &#x201c;structure-activity&#x201d; considerations and serviceable computer software programs are abundant. The following examples are provided in a non-limiting fashion and are hereby incorporated by reference. Molecular Simulations Inc. of San Diego, Calif. is a subsidiary of Pharmacopeia, Inc. provides the following software programs that are useful for this invention: Gene Explorer&#x2122;, ViewerPro&#x2122;, SeqFold, Insight II, Biploymer, Homology, MODELER, Profiles-3D, Binding Site Analysis, and CFF.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">In vivo Shuffling</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0442">In an embodiment of in vivo shuffling, the mixed population of the specific nucleic acid sequence is introduced into bacterial or eukaryotic cells under conditions such that at least two different nucleic acid sequences are present in each host cell. The polynucleotides can be introduced into the host cells by a variety of different methods. The host cells can be transformed with the smaller polynucleotides using methods known in the art, for example treatment with calcium chloride. If the polynucleotides are inserted into a phage genome, the host cell can be transfected with the recombinant phage genome having the specific nucleic acid sequences. Alternatively, the nucleic acid sequences can be introduced into the host cell using electroporation, transfection, lipofection, biolistics, conjugation, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0443">In general, in this embodiment, the specific nucleic acids sequences will be present in vectors which are capable of stably replicating the sequence in the host cell. In addition, it is contemplated that the vectors will encode a marker gene such that host cells having the vector can be selected. This ensures that the mutated specific nucleic acid sequence can be recovered after introduction into the host cell. However, it is contemplated that the entire mixed population of the specific nucleic acid sequences need not be present on a vector sequence. Rather only a sufficient number of sequences need be cloned into vectors to ensure that after introduction of the polynucleotides into the host cells each host cell contains one vector having at least one specific nucleic acid sequence present therein. It is also contemplated that rather than having a subset of the population of the specific nucleic acids sequences cloned into vectors, this subset may be already stably integrated into the host cell.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0444">It has been found that when two polynucleotides which have regions of identity are inserted into the host cells homologous recombination occurs between the two polynucleotides. Such recombination between the two mutated specific nucleic acid sequences will result in the production of double or triple hybrids in some situations.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0445">It has also been found that the frequency of recombination is increased if some of the mutated specific nucleic acid sequences are present on linear nucleic acid molecules. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, some of the specific nucleic acid sequences are present on linear polynucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0446">After transformation, the host cell transformants are placed under selection to identify those host cell transformants which contain mutated specific nucleic acid sequences having the qualities desired. For example, if increased resistance to a particular drug is desired then the transformed host cells may be subjected to increased concentrations of the particular drug and those transformants producing mutated proteins able to confer increased drug resistance will be selected. If the enhanced ability of a particular protein to bind to a receptor is desired, then expression of the protein can be induced from the transformants and the resulting protein assayed in a ligand binding assay by methods known in the art to identify that subset of the mutated population which shows enhanced binding to the ligand. Alternatively, the protein can be expressed in another system to ensure proper processing.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0447">Once a subset of the first recombined specific nucleic acid sequences (daughter sequences) having the desired characteristics are identified, they are then subject to a second round of recombination.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0448">In the second cycle of recombination, the recombined specific nucleic acid sequences may be mixed with the original mutated specific nucleic acid sequences (parent sequences) and the cycle repeated as described above. In this way a set of second recombined specific nucleic acids sequences can be identified which have enhanced characteristics or encode for proteins having enhanced properties. This cycle can be repeated a number of times as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0449">It is also contemplated that in the second or subsequent recombination cycle, a backcross can be performed. A molecular backcross can be performed by mixing the desired specific nucleic acid sequences with a large number of the wild-type sequence, such that at least one wild-type nucleic acid sequence and a mutated nucleic acid sequence are present in the same host cell after transformation. Recombination with the wild-type specific nucleic acid sequence will eliminate those neutral mutations that may affect unselected characteristics such as immunogenicity but not the selected characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0450">In another embodiment of this invention, it is contemplated that during the first round a subset of the specific nucleic acid sequences can be generated as smaller polynucleotides by slowing or halting their PCR amplification prior to introduction into the host cell. The size of the polynucleotides must be large enough to contain some regions of identity with the other sequences so as to homologously recombine with the other sequences. The size of the polynucleotides will range from 0.03 kb to 100 kb more preferably from 0.2 kb to 10 kb. It is also contemplated that in subsequent rounds, all of the specific nucleic acid sequences other than the sequences selected from the previous round may be utilized to generate PCR polynucleotides prior to introduction into the host cells.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0451">The shorter polynucleotide sequences can be single-stranded or double-stranded. If the sequences were originally single-stranded and have become double-stranded they can be denatured with heat, chemicals or enzymes prior to insertion into the host cell. The reaction conditions suitable for separating the strands of nucleic acid are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0452">The steps of this process can be repeated indefinitely, being limited only by the number of possible hybrids which can be achieved. After a certain number of cycles, all possible hybrids will have been achieved and further cycles are redundant.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0453">In an embodiment the same mutated template nucleic acid is repeatedly recombined and the resulting recombinants selected for the desired characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0454">Therefore, the initial pool or population of mutated template nucleic acid is cloned into a vector capable of replicating in a bacteria such as E. coli. The particular vector is not essential, so long as it is capable of autonomous replication in E. coli. In a preferred embodiment, the vector is designed to allow the expression and production of any protein encoded by the mutated specific nucleic acid linked to the vector. It is also preferred that the vector contain a gene encoding for a selectable marker.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0455">The population of vectors containing the pool of mutated nucleic acid sequences is introduced into the E. coli host cells. The vector nucleic acid sequences may be introduced by transformation, transfection or infection in the case of phage. The concentration of vectors used to transform the bacteria is such that a number of vectors is introduced into each cell. Once present in the cell, the efficiency of homologous recombination is such that homologous recombination occurs between the various vectors. This results in the generation of hybrids (daughters) having a combination of mutations which differ from the original parent mutated sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0456">The host cells are then clonally replicated and selected for the marker gene present on the vector. Only those cells having a plasmid will grow under the selection.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0457">The host cells which contain a vector are then tested for the presence of favorable mutations. Such testing may consist of placing the cells under selective pressure, for example, if the gene to be selected is an improved drug resistance gene. If the vector allows expression of the protein encoded by the mutated nucleic acid sequence, then such selection may include allowing expression of the protein so encoded, isolation of the protein and testing of the protein to determine whether, for example, it binds with increased efficiency to the ligand of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0458">Once a particular daughter mutated nucleic acid sequence has been identified which confers the desired characteristics, the nucleic acid is isolated either already linked to the vector or separated from the vector. This nucleic acid is then mixed with the first or parent population of nucleic acids and the cycle is repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0459">It has been shown that by this method nucleic acid sequences having enhanced desired properties can be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0460">In an alternate embodiment, the first generation of hybrids are retained in the cells and the parental mutated sequences are added again to the cells. Accordingly, the first cycle of Embodiment I is conducted as described above. However, after the daughter nucleic acid sequences are identified, the host cells containing these sequences are retained.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0461">The parent mutated specific nucleic acid population, either as polynucleotides or cloned into the same vector is introduced into the host cells already containing the daughter nucleic acids. Recombination is allowed to occur in the cells and the next generation of recombinants, or granddaughters are selected by the methods described above.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0462">This cycle can be repeated a number of times until the nucleic acid or peptide having the desired characteristics is obtained. It is contemplated that in subsequent cycles, the population of mutated sequences which are added to the preferred hybrids may come from the parental hybrids or any subsequent generation.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0463">In an alternative embodiment, the invention provides a method of conducting a &#x201c;molecular&#x201d; backcross of the obtained recombinant specific nucleic acid in order to eliminate any neutral mutations. Neutral mutations are those mutations which do not confer onto the nucleic acid or peptide the desired properties. Such mutations may however confer on the nucleic acid or peptide undesirable characteristics. Accordingly, it is desirable to eliminate such neutral mutations. The method of this invention provide a means of doing so.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0464">In this embodiment, after the hybrid nucleic acid, having the desired characteristics, is obtained by the methods of the embodiments, the nucleic acid, the vector having the nucleic acid or the host cell containing the vector and nucleic acid is isolated.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0465">The nucleic acid or vector is then introduced into the host cell with a large excess of the wild-type nucleic acid. The nucleic acid of the hybrid and the nucleic acid of the wild-type sequence are allowed to recombine. The resulting recombinants are placed under the same selection as the hybrid nucleic acid. Only those recombinants which retained the desired characteristics will be selected. Any silent mutations which do not provide the desired characteristics will be lost through recombination with the wild-type DNA. This cycle can be repeated a number of times until all of the silent mutations are eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0466">Thus the methods of this invention can be used in a molecular backcross to eliminate unnecessary or silent mutations.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Utility</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0467">The in vivo recombination method of this invention can be performed blindly on a pool of unknown hybrids or alleles of a specific polynucleotide or sequence. However, it is not necessary to know the actual DNA or RNA sequence of the specific polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0468">The approach of using recombination within a mixed population of genes can be useful for the generation of any useful proteins, for example, interleukin I, antibodies, tPA and growth hormone. This approach may be used to generate proteins having altered specificity or activity. The approach may also be useful for the generation of hybrid nucleic acid sequences, for example, promoter regions, introns, exons, enhancer sequences, 31 untranslated regions or 51 untranslated regions of genes. Thus this approach may be used to generate genes having increased rates of expression. This approach may also be useful in the study of repetitive DNA sequences. Finally, this approach may be useful to mutate ribozymes or aptamers.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0469">Scaffold-like regions separating regions of diversity in proteins may be particularly suitable for the methods of this invention. The conserved scaffold determines the overall folding by self-association, while displaying relatively unrestricted loops that mediate the specific binding. Examples of such scaffolds are the immunoglobulin beta barrel, and the four-helix bundle. The methods of this invention can be used to create scaffold-like proteins with various combinations of mutated sequences for binding.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0470">The equivalents of some standard genetic matings may also be performed by the methods of this invention. For example, a &#x201c;molecular&#x201d; backcross can be performed by repeated mixing of the hybrid's nucleic acid with the wild-type nucleic acid while selecting for the mutations of interest. As in traditional breeding, this approach can be used to combine phenotypes from different sources into a background of choice. It is useful, for example, for the removal of neutral mutations that affect unselected characteristics (i.e. immunogenicity). Thus it can be useful to determine which mutations in a protein are involved in the enhanced biological activity and which are not.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Peptide Display Methods</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0471">The present method can be used to shuffle, by in vitro and/or in vivo recombination by any of the disclosed methods, and in any combination, polynucleotide sequences selected by peptide display methods, wherein an associated polynucleotide encodes a displayed peptide which is screened for a phenotype (e.g., for affinity for a predetermined receptor (ligand).</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0472">An increasingly important aspect of bio-pharmaceutical drug development and molecular biology is the identification of peptide structures, including the primary amino acid sequences, of peptides or peptidomimetics that interact with biological macromolecules. one method of identifying peptides that possess a desired structure or functional property, such as binding to a predetermined biological macromolecule (e.g., a receptor), involves the screening of a large library or peptides for individual library members which possess the desired structure or functional property conferred by the amino acid sequence of the peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0473">In addition to direct chemical synthesis methods for generating peptide libraries, several recombinant DNA methods also have been reported. One type involves the display of a peptide sequence, antibody, or other protein on the surface of a bacteriophage particle or cell. Generally, in these methods each bacteriophage particle or cell serves as an individual library member displaying a single species of displayed peptide in addition to the natural bacteriophage or cell protein sequences. Each bacteriophage or cell contains the nucleotide sequence information encoding the particular displayed peptide sequence; thus, the displayed peptide sequence can be ascertained by nucleotide sequence determination of an isolated library member.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0474">A well-known peptide display method involves the presentation of a peptide sequence on the surface of a filamentous bacteriophage, typically as a fusion with a bacteriophage coat protein. The bacteriophage library can be incubated with an immobilized, predetermined macromolecule or small molecule (e.g., a receptor) so that bacteriophage particles which present a peptide sequence that binds to the immobilized macromolecule can be differentially partitioned from those that do not present peptide sequences that bind to the predetermined macromolecule. The bacteriophage particles (i.e., library members) which are bound to the immobilized macromolecule are then recovered and replicated to amplify the selected bacteriophage sub-population for a subsequent round of affinity enrichment and phage replication. After several rounds of affinity enrichment and phage replication, the bacteriophage library members that are thus selected are isolated and the nucleotide sequence encoding the displayed peptide sequence is determined, thereby identifying the sequence(s) of peptides that bind to the predetermined macromolecule (e.g., receptor). Such methods are further described in PCT patent publications WO 91/17271, WO 91/18980, WO 91/19818 and WO 93108278.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0475">The latter PCT publication describes a recombinant DNA method for the display of peptide ligands that involves the production of a library of fusion proteins with each fusion protein composed of a first polypeptide portion, typically comprising a variable sequence, that is available for potential binding to a predetermined macromolecule, and a second polypeptide portion that binds to DNA, such as the DNA vector encoding the individual fusion protein. When transformed host cells are cultured under conditions that allow for expression of the fusion protein, the fusion protein binds to the DNA vector encoding it. Upon lysis of the host cell, the fusion protein/vector DNA complexes can be screened against a predetermined macromolecule in much the same way as bacteriophage particles are screened in the phage-based display system, with the replication and sequencing of the DNA vectors in the selected fusion protein/vector DNA complexes serving as the basis for identification of the selected library peptide sequence(s).</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0476">Other systems for generating libraries of peptides and like polymers have aspects of both the recombinant and in vitro chemical synthesis methods. In these hybrid methods, cell-free enzymatic machinery is employed to accomplish the in vitro synthesis of the library members (i.e., peptides or polynucleotides). In one type of method, RNA molecules with the ability to bind a predetermined protein or a predetermined dye molecule were selected by alternate rounds of selection and PCR amplification (Therk and Gold, 1990; Ellington and Szostak, 1990). A similar technique was used to identify DNA sequences which bind a predetermined human transcription factor (Thiesen and Bach, 1990; Beaudry and Joyce, 1992; PCT patent publications WO 92/05258 and WO 92/14843). In a similar fashion, the technique of in vitro translation has been used to synthesize proteins of interest and has been proposed as a method for generating large libraries of peptides. These methods which rely upon in vitro translation, generally comprising stabilized polysome complexes, are described further in PCT patent publications WO 88/08453, WO 90/05785, WO 90/07003, WO 91/02076, WO 91/05058, and WO 92/02536. Applicants have described methods in which library members comprise a fusion protein having a first polypeptide portion with DNA binding activity and a second polypeptide portion having the library member unique peptide sequence; such methods are suitable for use in cell-free in vitro selection formats, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0477">The displayed peptide sequences can be of varying lengths, typically from 3-5000 amino acids long or longer, frequently from 5-100 amino acids long, and often from about 8-15 amino acids long. A library can comprise library members having varying lengths of displayed peptide sequence, or may comprise library members having a fixed length of displayed peptide sequence. Portions or all of the displayed peptide sequence(s) can be random, pseudorandom, defined set kernal, fixed, or the like. The present display methods include methods for in vitro and in vivo display of single-chain antibodies, such as nascent scFv on polysomes or scfv displayed on phage, which enable large-scale screening of scfv libraries having broad diversity of variable region sequences and binding specificities.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0478">The present invention also provides random, pseudorandom, and defined sequence framework peptide libraries and methods for generating and screening those libraries to identify useful compounds (e.g., peptides, including single-chain antibodies) that bind to receptor molecules or epitopes of interest or gene products that modify peptides or RNA in a desired fashion. The random, pseudorandom, and defined sequence framework peptides are produced from libraries of peptide library members that comprise displayed peptides or displayed single-chain antibodies attached to a polynucleotide template from which the displayed peptide was synthesized. The mode of attachment may vary according to the specific embodiment of the invention selected, and can include encapsulation in a phage particle or incorporation in a cell.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0479">A method of affinity enrichment allows a very large library of peptides and single-chain antibodies to be screened and the polynucleotide sequence encoding the desired peptide(s) or single-chain antibodies to be selected. The polynucleotide can then be isolated and shuffled to recombine combinatorially the amino acid sequence of the selected peptide(s) (or predetermined portions thereof) or single-chain antibodies (or just VHI, VLI or CDR portions thereof). Using these methods, one can identify a peptide or single-chain antibody as having a desired binding affinity for a molecule and can exploit the process of shuffling to converge rapidly to a desired high-affinity peptide or scfv. The peptide or antibody can then be synthesized in bulk by conventional means for any suitable use (e.g., as a therapeutic or diagnostic agent).</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0480">A significant advantage of the present invention is that no prior information regarding an expected ligand structure is required to isolate peptide ligands or antibodies of interest. The peptide identified can have biological activity, which is meant to include at least specific binding affinity for a selected receptor molecule and, in some instances, will further include the ability to block the binding of other compounds, to stimulate or inhibit metabolic pathways, to act as a signal or messenger, to stimulate or inhibit cellular activity, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0481">The present invention also provides a method for shuffling a pool of polynucleotide sequences selected by affinity screening a library of polysomes displaying nascent peptides (including single-chain antibodies) for library members which bind to a predetermined receptor (e.g., a mammalian proteinaceous receptor such as, for example, a peptidergic hormone receptor, a cell surface receptor, an intracellular protein which binds to other protein(s) to form intracellular protein complexes such as hetero-dimers and the like) or epitope (e.g., an immobilized protein, glycoprotein, oligosaccharide, and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0482">Polynucleotide sequences selected in a first selection round (typically by affinity selection for binding to a receptor (e.g., a ligand)) by any of these methods are pooled and the pool(s) is/are shuffled by in vitro and/or in vivo recombination to produce a shuffled pool comprising a population of recombined selected polynucleotide sequences. The recombined selected polynucleotide sequences are subjected to at least one subsequent selection round. The polynucleotide sequences selected in the subsequent selection round(s) can be used directly, sequenced, and/or subjected to one or more additional rounds of shuffling and subsequent selection. Selected sequences can also be back-crossed with polynucleotide sequences encoding neutral sequences (i.e., having insubstantial functional effect on binding), such as for example by back-crossing with a wild-type or naturally-occurring sequence substantially identical to a selected sequence to produce native-like functional peptides, which may be less immunogenic. Generally, during back-crossing subsequent selection is applied to retain the property of binding to the predetermined receptor (ligand).</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0483">Prior to or concomitant with the shuffling of selected sequences, the sequences can be mutagenized. In one embodiment, selected library members are cloned in a prokaryotic vector (e.g., plasmid, phagemid, or bacteriophage) wherein a collection of individual colonies (or plaques) representing discrete library members are produced. Individual selected library members can then be manipulated (e.g., by site-directed mutagenesis, cassette mutagenesis, chemical mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and the like) to generate a collection of library members representing a kernal of sequence diversity based on the sequence of the selected library member. The sequence of an individual selected library member or pool can be manipulated to incorporate random mutation, pseudorandom mutation, defined kernal mutation (i.e., comprising variant and invariant residue positions and/or comprising variant residue positions which can comprise a residue selected from a defined subset of amino acid residues), codon-based mutation, and the like, either segmentally or over the entire length of the individual selected library member sequence. The mutagenized selected library members are then shuffled by in vitro and/or in vivo recombinatorial shuffling as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0484">The invention also provides peptide libraries comprising a plurality of individual library members of the invention, wherein (1) each individual library member of said plurality comprises a sequence produced by shuffling of a pool of selected sequences, and (2) each individual library member comprises a variable peptide segment sequence or single-chain antibody segment sequence which is distinct from the variable peptide segment sequences or single-chain antibody sequences of other individual library members in said plurality (although some library members may be present in more than one copy per library due to uneven amplification, stochastic probability, or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0485">The invention also provides a product-by-process, wherein selected polynucleotide sequences having (or encoding a peptide having) a predetermined binding specificity are formed by the process of: (1) screening a displayed peptide or displayed single-chain antibody library against a predetermined receptor (e.g., ligand) or epitope (e.g., antigen macromolecule) and identifying and/or enriching library members which bind to the predetermined receptor or epitope to produce a pool of selected library members, (2) shuffling by recombination the selected library members (or amplified or cloned copies thereof) which binds the predetermined epitope and has been thereby isolated and/or enriched from the library to generate a shuffled library, and (3) screening the shuffled library against the predetermined receptor (e.g., ligand) or epitope (e.g., antigen macromolecule) and identifying and/or enriching shuffled library members which bind to the predetermined receptor or epitope to produce a pool of selected shuffled library members.</p>

<p id="p-0377" num="0486">The present method can be used to shuffle, by in vitro and/or in vivo recombination by any of the disclosed methods, and in any combination, polynucleotide sequences selected by antibody display methods, wherein an associated polynucleotide encodes a displayed antibody which is screened for a phenotype (e.g., for affinity for binding a predetermined antigen (ligand).</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0487">Various molecular genetic approaches have been devised to capture the vast immunological repertoire represented by the extremely large number of distinct variable regions which can be present in immunoglobulin chains. The naturally-occurring germ line immunoglobulin heavy chain locus is composed of separate tandem arrays of variable segment genes located upstream of a tandem array of diversity segment genes, which are themselves located upstream of a tandem array of joining (i) region genes, which are located upstream of the constant region genes. During B lymphocyte development, V-D-J rearrangement occurs wherein a heavy chain variable region gene (VH) is formed by rearrangement to form a fused D segment followed by rearrangement with a V segment to form a V-D-J joined product gene which, if productively rearranged, encodes a functional variable region (VH) of a heavy chain. Similarly, light chain loci rearrange one of several V segments with one of several J segments to form a gene encoding the variable region (VL) of a light chain.</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0488">The vast repertoire of variable regions possible in immunoglobulins derives in part from the numerous combinatorial possibilities of joining V and <?delete-start id="REI-00030"  date="20150120" ?>i<?delete-end id="REI-00030" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00031"  date="20150120" ?>J <?insert-end id="REI-00031" ?>segments (and, in the case of heavy chain loci, D segments) during rearrangement in B cell development. Additional sequence diversity in the heavy chain variable regions arises from non-uniform rearrangements of the D segments during V-D-J joining and from N region addition. Further, antigen-selection of specific B cell clones selects for higher affinity variants having non-<?delete-start id="REI-00032"  date="20150120" ?>germnline<?delete-end id="REI-00032" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00033"  date="20150120" ?>germline <?insert-end id="REI-00033" ?>mutations in one or both of the heavy and light chain variable regions; a phenomenon referred to as &#x201c;affinity maturation&#x201d; or &#x201c;affinity sharpening&#x201d;. Typically, these &#x201c;affinity sharpening&#x201d; mutations cluster in specific areas of the variable region, most commonly in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs).</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0489">In order to overcome many of the limitations in producing and identifying high-affinity immunoglobulins through antigen-stimulated B cell development (i.e., immunization), various prokaryotic expression systems have been developed that can be manipulated to produce combinatorial antibody libraries which may be screened for high-affinity antibodies to specific antigens. Recent advances in the expression of antibodies in Escherichia coli and bacteriophage systems (see &#x201c;alternative peptide display methods&#x201d;, infra) have raised the possibility that virtually any specificity can be obtained by either cloning antibody genes from characterized hybridomas or by de novo selection using antibody gene libraries (e.g., from Ig cDNA).</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0490">Combinatorial libraries of antibodies have been generated in bacteriophage lambda expression systems which may be screened as bacteriophage plaques or as colonies of lysogens (Huse et al, 1989); Caton and Koprowski, 1990; Mullinax et al, 1990; Persson et al, 1991). Various embodiments of bacteriophage antibody display libraries and lambda phage expression libraries have been described (Kang et al, 1991; Clackson et al, 1991; McCafferty et al, 1990; Burton et al, 1991; Hoogenboom et al, 1991; Chang et al, 1991; Breitling et al, 1991; Marks et al, 1991, p. 581; Barbas et al, 1992; Hawkins and Winter, 1992; Marks et al, 1992, p. 779; Marks et al, 1992, p. 16007; and Lowman et al, 1991; Lerner et al, 1992; all incorporated herein by reference). Typically, a bacteriophage antibody display library is screened with a receptor (e.g., polypeptide, carbohydrate, glycoprotein, nucleic acid) that is immobilized (e.g., by covalent linkage to a chromatography resin to enrich for reactive phage by affinity chromatography) and/or labeled (e.g., to screen plaque or colony lifts).</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0491">One particularly advantageous approach has been the use of so-called single-chain fragment variable (scfv) libraries (Marks et al, 1992, p. 779; Winter and Milstein, 1991; Clackson et al, 1991; Marks et al, 1991, p. 581; Chaudhary et al, 1990; Chiiswell et al, 1992; McCafferty et al, 1990; and Huston et al, 1988). Various embodiments of scfv libraries displayed on bacteriophage coat proteins have been described.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0492">Beginning in 1988, single-chain analogues of Fv fragments and their fusion proteins have been reliably generated by antibody engineering methods. The first step generally involves obtaining the genes encoding VH and VL domains with desired binding properties; these V genes may be isolated from a specific hybridoma cell line, selected from a combinatorial V-gene library, or made by V gene synthesis. The single-chain Fv is formed by connecting the component V genes with an oligonucleotide that encodes an appropriately designed linker peptide, such as (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser)3 <?insert-start id="REI-00034"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 26) <?insert-end id="REI-00034" ?>or equivalent linker peptide(s). The linker bridges the C-terminus of the first V region and N-terminus of the second, ordered as either VH-linker-VL or VL-linker-VH&#x2032; In principle, the scfv binding site can faithfully replicate both the affinity and specificity of its parent antibody combining site.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0493">Thus, scfv fragments are comprised of VH and VL domains linked into a single polypeptide chain by a flexible linker peptide. After the scfv genes are assembled, they are cloned into a phagemid and expressed at the tip of the M13 phage (or similar filamentous bacteriophage) as fusion proteins with the bacteriophage PIII (gene 3) coat protein. Enriching for phage expressing an antibody of interest is accomplished by panning the recombinant phage displaying a population scfv for binding to a predetermined epitope (e.g., target antigen, receptor).</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0494">The linked polynucleotide of a library member provides the basis for replication of the library member after a screening or selection procedure, and also provides the basis for the determination, by nucleotide sequencing, of the identity of the displayed peptide sequence or VH and VL amino acid sequence. The displayed peptide (s) or single-chain antibody (e.g., scfv) and/or its VH and VL domains or their CDRs can be cloned and expressed in a suitable expression system. Often polynucleotides encoding the isolated VH and VL domains will be ligated to polynucleotides encoding constant regions (CH and CL) to form polynucleotides encoding complete antibodies (e.g., chimeric or fully-human), antibody fragments, and the like. Often polynucleotides encoding the isolated CDRs will be grafted into polynucleotides encoding a suitable variable region framework (and optionally constant regions) to form polynucleotides encoding complete antibodies (e.g., humanized or fully-human), antibody fragments, and the like. Antibodies can be used to isolate preparative quantities of the antigen by immunoaffinity chromatography. Various other uses of such antibodies are to diagnose and/or stage disease (e.g., neoplasia) and for therapeutic application to treat disease, such as for example: neoplasia, autoimmune disease, AIDS, cardiovascular disease, infections, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0495">Various methods have been reported for increasing the combinatorial diversity of a scfv library to broaden the repertoire of binding species (idiotype spectrum) The use of PCR has permitted the variable regions to be rapidly cloned either from a specific hybridoma source or as a gene library from non-immunized cells, affording combinatorial diversity in the assortment of VH and VL cassettes which can be combined. Furthermore, the VH and VL cassettes can themselves be diversified, such as by random, pseudorandom, or directed mutagenesis. Typically, VH and VL cassettes are diversified in. or near the complementarity-determining regions (CDRS), often the third CDR, CDR3. Enzymatic inverse PCR mutagenesis has been shown to be a simple and reliable method for constructing relatively large libraries of scfv site-directed hybrids (Stemmer et al, 1993), as has error-prone PCR and chemical mutagenesis (Deng et al, 1994). Riechmann (Riechmann et al, 1993) showed semirational design of an antibody scfv fragment using site-directed randomization by degenerate oligonucleotide PCR and subsequent phage display of the resultant scfv hybrids. Barbas (Barbas et al, 1992) attempted to circumvent the problem of limited repertoire sizes resulting from using biased variable region sequences by randomizing the sequence in a synthetic CDR region of a human tetanus toxoid-binding Fab.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0496">CDR randomization has the potential to create approximately 1&#xd7;10<sup>20 </sup>CDRs for the heavy chain CDR3 alone, and a roughly similar number of variants of the heavy chain CDR1 and CDR2, and light chain CDR1-3 variants. Taken individually or together, the combination possibilities of CDR randomization of heavy and/or light chains requires generating a prohibitive number of bacteriophage clones to produce a clone library representing all possible combinations, the vast majority of which will be non-binding. Generation of such large numbers of primary transformants is not feasible with current transformation technology and bacteriophage display systems. For example, Barbas (Barbas et al, 1992) only generated 5&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>transformants, which represents only a tiny fraction of the potential diversity of a library of thoroughly randomized CDRS.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0497">Despite these substantial limitations, bacteriophage display of scfv have already yielded a variety of useful antibodies and antibody fusion proteins. A bispecific single chain antibody has been shown to mediate efficient tumor cell lysis (Gruber et al, 1994). Intracellular expression of an anti-Rev scfv has been shown to inhibit HIV-1 virus replication in vitro (Duan et al, 1994), and intracellular expression of an anti-p21rar, scfv has been shown to inhibit meiotic maturation of Xenopus oocytes (Biocca et al, 1993). Recombinant scfv which can be used to diagnose HIV infection have also been reported, demonstrating the diagnostic utility of scfv (Lilley et al, 1994). Fusion proteins wherein an scFv is linked to a second polypeptide, such as a toxin or fibrinolytic activator protein, have also been reported (Holvost et al, 1992; Nicholls et al, 1993).</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0498">If it were possible to generate scfv libraries having broader antibody diversity and overcoming many of the limitations of conventional CDR mutagenesis and randomization methods which can cover only a very tiny fraction of the potential sequence combinations, the number and quality of scfv antibodies suitable for therapeutic and diagnostic use could be vastly improved. To address this, the in vitro and in vivo shuffling methods of the invention are used to recombine CDRs which have been obtained (typically via PCR amplification or cloning) from nucleic acids obtained from selected displayed antibodies. Such displayed antibodies can be displayed on cells, on bacteriophage particles, on polysomes, or any suitable antibody display system wherein the antibody is associated with its encoding nucleic acid(s). In a variation, the CDRs are initially obtained from mRNA (or cDNA) from antibody-producing cells (e.g., plasma cells/splenocytes from an immunized wild-type mouse, a human, or a transgenic mouse capable of making a human antibody as in WO 92/03918, WO 93/12227, and WO 94/25585), including hybridomas derived therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0499">Polynucleotide sequences selected in a first selection round (typically by affinity selection for displayed antibody binding to an antigen (e.g., a ligand) by any of these methods are pooled and the pool(s) is/are shuffled by in vitro and/or in vivo recombination, especially shuffling of CDRs (typically shuffling heavy chain CDRs with other heavy chain CDRs and light chain CDRs with other light chain CDRs) to produce a shuffled pool comprising a population of recombined selected polynucleotide sequences. The recombined selected polynucleotide sequences are expressed in a selection format as a displayed antibody and subjected to at least one subsequent selection round. The polynucleotide sequences selected in the subsequent selection round(s) can be used directly, sequenced, and/or subjected to one or more additional rounds of shuffling and subsequent selection until an antibody of the desired binding affinity is obtained. Selected sequences can also be back-crossed with polynucleotide sequences encoding neutral antibody framework sequences (i.e., having insubstantial functional effect on antigen binding), such as for example by back-crossing with a human variable region framework to produce human-like sequence antibodies. Generally, during back-crossing subsequent selection is applied to retain the property of binding to the predetermined antigen.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0500">Alternatively, or in combination with the noted variations, the valency of the target epitope may be varied to control the average binding affinity of selected scfv library members. The target epitope can be bound to a surface or substrate at varying densities, such as by including a competitor epitope, by dilution, or by other method known to those in the art. A high density (valency) of predetermined epitope can be used to enrich for scfv library members which have relatively low affinity, whereas a low density (valency) can preferentially enrich for higher affinity scfv library members.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0501">For generating diverse variable segments, a collection of synthetic oligonucleotides encoding random, pseudorandom, or a defined sequence kernal set of peptide sequences can be inserted by ligation into a predetermined site (e.g., a CDR). Similarly, the sequence diversity of one or more CDRs of the single-chain antibody cassette(s) can be expanded by mutating the CDR(s) with site-directed mutagenesis, CDR-replacement, and the like. The resultant DNA molecules can be propagated in a host for cloning and amplification prior to shuffling, or can be used directly (i.e., may avoid loss of diversity which may occur upon propagation in a host cell) and the selected library members subsequently shuffled.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0502">Displayed peptide/polynucleotide complexes (library members) which encode a variable segment peptide sequence of interest or a single-chain antibody of interest are selected from the library by an affinity enrichment technique. This is accomplished by means of a immobilized macromolecule or epitope specific for the peptide sequence of interest, such as a receptor, other macromolecule, or other epitope species. Repeating the affinity selection procedure provides an enrichment of library members encoding the desired sequences, which may then be isolated for pooling and shuffling, for sequencing, and/or for further propagation and affinity enrichment.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0503">The library members without the desired specificity are removed by washing. The degree and stringency of washing required will be determined for each peptide sequence or single-chain antibody of interest and the immobilized predetermined macromolecule or epitope. A certain degree of control can be exerted over the binding characteristics of the nascent peptide/DNA complexes recovered by adjusting the conditions of the binding incubation and the subsequent washing. The temperature, pH, ionic strength, divalent cations concentration, and the volume and duration of the washing will select for nascent peptide/DNA complexes within particular ranges of affinity for the immobilized macromolecule. Selection based on slow dissociation rate, which is usually predictive of high affinity, is often the most practical route. This may be done either by continued incubation in the presence of a saturating amount of free predetermined macromolecule, or by increasing the volume, number, and length of the washes. In each case, the rebinding of dissociated nascent peptide/DNA or peptide/RNA complex is prevented, and with increasing time, nascent peptide/DNA or peptide/RNA complexes of higher and higher affinity are recovered.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0504">Additional modifications of the binding and washing procedures may be applied to find peptides with special characteristics. The affinities of some peptides are dependent on ionic strength or cation concentration. This is a useful characteristic for peptides that will be used in affinity purification of various proteins when gentle conditions for removing the protein from the peptides are required.</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0505">One variation involves the use of multiple binding targets (multiple epitope species, multiple receptor species), such that a scfv library can be simultaneously screened for a multiplicity of scfv which have different binding specificities. Given that the size of a scfv library often limits the diversity of potential scfv sequences, it is typically desirable to us scfv libraries of as large a size as possible. The time and economic considerations of generating a number of very large polysome scFv-display libraries can become prohibitive. To avoid this substantial problem, multiple predetermined epitope species (receptor species) can be concomitantly screened in a single library, or sequential screening against a number of epitope species can be used. In one variation, multiple target epitope species, each encoded on a separate bead (or subset of beads), can be mixed and incubated with a polysome-display scfv library under suitable binding conditions. The collection of beads, comprising multiple epitope species, can then be used to isolate, by affinity selection, scfv library members. Generally, subsequent affinity screening rounds can include the same mixture of beads, subsets thereof, or beads containing only one or two individual epitope species. This approach affords efficient screening, and is compatible with laboratory automation, batch processing, and high throughput screening methods.</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0506">A variety of techniques can be used in the present invention to diversify a peptide library or single-chain antibody library, or to diversify, prior to or concomitant with shuffling, around variable segment peptides found in early rounds of panning to have sufficient binding activity to the predetermined macromolecule or epitope. In one approach, the positive selected peptide/polynucleotide complexes (those identified in an early round of affinity enrichment) are sequenced to determine the identity of the active peptides. Oligonucleotides are then synthesized based on these active peptide sequences, employing a low level of all bases incorporated at each step to produce slight variations of the primary oligonucleotide sequences. This mixture of (slightly) degenerate oligonucleotides is then cloned into the variable segment sequences at the appropriate locations. This method produces systematic, controlled variations of the starting peptide sequences, which can then be shuffled. It requires, however, that individual positive nascent peptide/polynucleotide complexes be sequenced before mutagenesis, and thus is useful for expanding the diversity of small numbers of recovered complexes and selecting variants having higher binding affinity and/or higher binding specificity. In a variation, mutagenic PCR amplification of positive selected peptide/polynucleotide complexes (especially of the variable region sequences, the amplification products of which are shuffled in vitro and/or in vivo and one or more additional rounds of screening is done prior to sequencing. The same general approach can be employed with single-chain antibodies in order to expand the diversity and enhance the binding affinity/specificity, typically by diversifying CDRs or adjacent framework regions prior to or concomitant with shuffling. If desired, shuffling reactions can be spiked with mutagenic oligonucleotides capable of in vitro recombination with the selected library members can be included. Thus, mixtures of synthetic oligonucleotides and PCR produced polynucleotides (synthesized by error-prone or high-fidelity methods) can be added to the in vitro shuffling mix and be incorporated into resulting shuffled library members (shufflants).</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0507">The present invention of shuffling enables the generation of a vast library of CDR-variant single-chain antibodies. One way to generate such antibodies is to insert synthetic CDRs into the single-chain antibody and/or CDR randomization prior to or concomitant with shuffling. The sequences of the synthetic CDR cassettes are selected by referring to known sequence data of human CDR and are selected in the discretion of the practitioner according to the following guidelines: synthetic CDRs will have at least 40 percent positional sequence identity to known CDR sequences, and preferably will have at least 50 to 70 percent positional sequence identity to known CDR sequences. For example, a collection of synthetic CDR sequences can be generated by synthesizing a collection of oligonucleotide sequences on the basis of naturally-occurring human CDR sequences listed in Kabat (Kabat et al, 1991); the pool(s) of synthetic CDR sequences are calculated to encode CDR peptide sequences having at least 40 percent sequence identity to at least one known naturally-occurring human CDR sequence. Alternatively, a collection of naturally-occurring CDR sequences may be compared to generate consensus sequences so that amino acids used at a residue position frequently (i.e., in at least 5 percent of known CDR sequences) are incorporated into the synthetic CDRs at the corresponding position(s). Typically, several (e.g., 3 to about 50) known CDR sequences are compared and observed natural sequence variations between the known CDRs are tabulated, and a collection of oligonucleotides encoding CDR peptide sequences encompassing all or most permutations of the observed natural sequence variations is synthesized. For example but not for limitation, if a collection of human VH CDR sequences have carboxy-terminal amino acids which are either Tyr, Val, Phe, or Asp, then the pool(s) of synthetic CDR oligonucleotide sequences are designed to allow the carboxy-terminal CDR residue to be any of these amino acids. In some embodiments, residues other than those which naturally-occur at a residue position in the collection of CDR sequences are incorporated: conservative amino acid substitutions are frequently incorporated and up to 5 residue positions may be varied to incorporate non-conservative amino acid substitutions as compared to known naturally-occurring CDR sequences. Such CDR sequences can be used in primary library members (prior to first round screening) and/or can be used to spike in vitro shuffling reactions of selected library member sequences. Construction of such pools of defined and/or degenerate sequences will be readily accomplished by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0508">The collection of synthetic CDR sequences comprises at least one member that is not known to be a naturally-occurring CDR sequence. It is within the discretion of the practitioner to include or not include a portion of random or pseudorandom sequence corresponding to N region addition in the heavy chain CDR; the N region sequence ranges from 1 nucleotide to about 4 nucleotides occurring at V-D and D-J junctions. A collection of synthetic heavy chain CDR sequences comprises at least about 100 unique CDR sequences, typically at least about 1,000 unique CDR sequences, preferably at least about 10,000 unique CDR sequences, frequently more than 50,000 unique CDR sequences; however, usually not more than about 1&#xd7;106 unique CDR sequences are included in the collection, although occasionally 1&#xd7;107 to 1&#xd7;108 unique CDR sequences are present, especially if conservative amino acid substitutions are permitted at positions where the conservative amino acid substituent is not present or is rare (i.e., less than 0.1 percent) in that position in naturally-occurring human CDRS. In general, the number of unique CDR sequences included in a library should not exceed the expected number of primary transformants in the library by more than a factor of 10. Such single-chain antibodies generally bind of about at least 1&#xd7;10 m-, preferably with an affinity of about at least 5&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>M&#x2212;1, more preferably with an affinity of at least 1&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>M&#x2212;1 to 1&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>M&#x2212;1 or more, sometimes up to 1&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>M&#x2212;1 or more. Frequently, the predetermined antigen is a human protein, such as for example a human cell surface antigen (e. g., CD4, CD8, IL-2 receptor, EGF receptor, PDGF receptor), other human biological macromolecule (e.g., thrombomodulin, protein C, carbohydrate antigen, sialyl Lewis antigen, Lselectin), or nonhuman disease associated macromolecule (e.g., bacterial LPS, virion capsid protein or envelope glycoprotein) and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0509">High affinity single-chain antibodies of the desired specificity can be engineered and expressed in a variety of as systems. For example, scfv have been produced in plants (Firek et al, 1993) and can be readily made in prokaryotic systems (Owens and Young, 1994; Johnson and Bird, 1991). Furthermore, the single-chain antibodies can be used as a basis for constructing whole antibodies or various fragments thereof (Kettleborough et al, 1994). The variable region encoding sequence may be isolated (e.g., by PCR amplification or subcloning) and spliced to a sequence encoding a desired human constant region to encode a human sequence antibody more suitable for human therapeutic uses where immunogenicity is preferably minimized. The polynucleotide(s) having the resultant fully human encoding sequence(s) can be expressed in a host cell (e.g., from an expression vector in a mammalian cell) and purified for pharmaceutical formulation.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0510">The DNA expression constructs will typically include an expression control DNA sequence operably linked to the coding sequences, including naturally-associated or heterologous promoter regions. Preferably, the expression control sequences will be eukaryotic promoter systems in vectors capable of transforming or transfecting eukaryotic host cells. Once the vector has been incorporated into the appropriate host, the host is maintained under conditions suitable for high level expression of the nucleotide sequences, and the collection and purification of the mutant' &#x201c;engineered&#x201d; antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0511">As stated previously, the DNA sequences will be expressed in hosts after the sequences have been operably linked to an expression control sequence (i.e., positioned to ensure the transcription and translation of the structural gene). These expression vectors are typically replicable in the host organisms either as episomes or as an integral part of the host chromosomal DNA. Commonly, expression vectors will contain selection markers, e.g., tetracycline or neomycin, to permit detection of those cells transformed with the desired DNA sequences (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,704,362, which is incorporated herein by reference).</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0512">In addition to eukaryotic microorganisms such as yeast, mammalian tissue cell culture may also be used to produce the polypeptides of the present invention (see Winnacker, 1987), which is incorporated herein by reference). Eukaryotic cells are actually preferred, because a number of suitable host cell lines capable of secreting intact immunoglobulins have been developed in the art, and include the CHO cell lines, various COS cell lines, HeLa cells, and myeloma cell lines, but preferably transformed Bcells or hybridomas. Expression vectors for these cells can include expression control sequences, such as an origin of replication, a promoter, an enhancer (Queen et al, 1986), and necessary processing information sites, such as ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites, and transcriptional terminator sequences. Preferred expression control sequences are promoters derived from immunoglobulin genes, cytomegalovirus, SV40, Adenovirus, Bovine Papilloma Virus, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0513">Eukaryotic DNA transcription can be increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers are cis-acting sequences of between 10 to 300 bp that increase transcription by a promoter. Enhancers can effectively increase transcription when either 51 or 31 to the transcription unit. They are also effective if located within an intron or within the coding sequence itself. Typically, viral enhancers are used, including SV40 enhancers, cytomegalovirus enhancers, polyoma enhancers, and adenovirus enhancers. Enhancer sequences from mammalian systems are also commonly used, such as the mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0514">Mammalian expression vector systems will also typically include a selectable marker gene. Examples of suitable markers include, the dihydrofolate reductase gene (DHFR), the thymidine kinase gene (TK), or prokaryotic genes conferring drug resistance. The first two marker genes prefer the use of mutant cell lines that lack the ability to grow without the addition of thymidine to the growth medium. Transformed cells can then be identified by their ability to grow on non-supplemented media. Examples of prokaryotic drug resistance genes useful as markers include genes conferring resistance to G418, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0515">The vectors containing the DNA segments of interest can be transferred into the host cell by well-known methods, depending on the type of cellular host. For example, calcium chloride transfection is commonly utilized for prokaryotic cells, whereas calcium phosphate treatment. lipofection, or electroporation may be used for other cellular hosts. Other methods used to transform mammalian cells include the use of Polybrene, protoplast fusion, liposomes, electroporation, and micro-injection (see, generally, Sambrook et al, 1982 and 1989).</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0516">Once expressed, the antibodies, individual mutated immunoglobulin chains, mutated antibody fragments, and other immunoglobulin polypeptides of the invention can be purified according to standard procedures of the art, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fraction column chromatography, gel electrophoresis and the like (see. generally, Scopes, 1982). Once purified, partially or to homogeneity as desired, the polypeptides may then be used therapeutically or in developing and performing assay procedures, immunofluorescent stainings, and the like (see, generally, Lefkovits and Pernis, 1979 and 1981; Lefkovits, 1997).</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0517">The antibodies generated by the method of the present invention can be used for diagnosis and therapy. By way of illustration and not limitation, they can be used to treat cancer, autoimmune diseases, or viral infections. For treatment of cancer, the antibodies will typically bind to an antigen expressed preferentially on cancer cells, such as erbB-2, CEA, CD33, and many other antigens and binding members well known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">End-Selection</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0518">This invention provides a method for selecting a subset of polynucleotides from a starting set of polynucleotides, which method is based on the ability to discriminate one or more selectable features (or selection markers) present anywhere in a working polynucleotide, so as to allow one to perform selection for (positive selection) &#x26;/or against (negative selection) each selectable polynucleotide. In a preferred aspect, a method is provided termed end-selection, which method is based on the use of a selection marker located in part or entirely in a terminal region of a selectable polynucleotide, and such a selection marker may be termed an &#x201c;end-selection marker&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0519">End-selection may be based on detection of naturally occurring sequences or on detection of sequences introduced experimentally (including by any mutagenesis procedure mentioned herein and not mentioned herein) or on both, even within the same polynucleotide. An end-selection marker can be a structural selection marker or a functional selection marker or both a structural and a functional selection marker. An end-selection marker may be comprised of a polynucleotide sequence or of a polypeptide sequence or of any chemical structure or of any biological or biochemical tag, including markers that can be selected using methods based on the detection of radioactivity, of enzymatic activity, of fluorescence, of any optical feature, of a magnetic property (e.g. using magnetic beads), of immunoreactivity, and of hybridization.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0520">End-selection may be applied in combination with any method serviceable for performing mutagenesis. Such mutagenesis methods include, but are not limited to, methods described herein (supra and infra). Such methods include, by way of non-limiting exemplification, any method that may be referred herein or by others in the art by any of the following terms: &#x201c;saturation mutagenesis&#x201d;, &#x201c;shuffling&#x201d;, &#x201c;recombination&#x201d;, &#x201c;re-assembly&#x201d;, &#x201c;error-prone PCR&#x201d;, &#x201c;assembly PCR&#x201d;, &#x201c;sexual PCR&#x201d;, &#x201c;crossover PCR&#x201d;; &#x201c;oligonucleotide primer-directed mutagenesis&#x201d;, &#x201c;recursive (&#x26;/or exponential) ensemble mutagenesis (see Arkin and Youvan, 1992)&#x201d;, &#x201c;cassette mutagenesis&#x201d;, &#x201c;in vivo mutagenesis&#x201d;, and &#x201c;in vitro mutagenesis&#x201d;. Moreover, end-selection may be performed on molecules produced by any mutagenesis &#x26;/or amplification method (see, e.g., Arnold, 1993; Caldwell and Joyce, 1992; Stemmer, 1994; following which method it is desirable to select for (including to screen for the presence of) desirable progeny molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0521">In addition, end-selection may be applied to a polynucleotide apart from any mutagenesis method. In a preferred embodiment, end-selection, as provided herein, can be used in order to facilitate a cloning step, such as a step of ligation to another polynucleotide (including ligation to a vector). This invention thus provides for end-selection as a serviceable means to facilitate library construction, selection &#x26;/or enrichment for desirable polynucleotides, and cloning in general.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0522">In a particularly preferred embodiment, end-selection can be based on (positive) selection for a polynucleotide; alternatively end-selection can be based on (negative) selection against a polynucleotide; and alternatively still, end-selection can be based on both (positive) selection for, and on (negative) selection against, a polynucleotide. End-selection, along with other methods of selection &#x26;/or screening, can be performed in an iterative fashion, with any combination of like or unlike selection &#x26;/or screening methods and serviceable mutagenesis methods, all of which can be performed in an iterative fashion and in any order, combination, and permutation.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0523">It is also appreciated that, according to one embodiment of this invention, end-selection may also be used to select a polynucleotide is at least in part: circular (e.g. a plasmid or any other circular vector or any other polynucleotide that is partly circular), &#x26;/or branched, &#x26;/or modified or substituted with any chemical group or moiety. In accord with this embodiment, a polynucleotide may be a circular molecule comprised of an intermediate or central region, which region is flanked on a 5&#x2032; side by a 5&#x2032; flanking region (which, for the purpose of end-selection, serves in like manner to a 5&#x2032; terminal region of a non-circular polynucleotide) and on a 3&#x2032; side by a 3&#x2032; terminal region (which, for the purpose of end-selection, serves in like manner to a 3&#x2032; terminal region of a non-circular polynucleotide). As used in this non-limiting exemplification, there may be sequence overlap between any two regions or even among all three regions.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0524">In one non-limiting aspect of this invention, end-selection of a linear polynucleotide is performed using a general approach based on the presence of at least one end-selection marker located at or near a polynucleotide end or terminus (that can be either a 5&#x2032; end or a 3&#x2032; end). In one particular non-limiting exemplification, end-selection is based on selection for a specific sequence at or near a terminus such as, but not limited to, a sequence recognized by an enzyme that recognizes a polynucleotide sequence. An enzyme that recognizes and catalyzes a chemical modification of a polynucleotide is referred to herein as a polynucleotide-acting enzyme. In a preferred embodiment, serviceable polynucleotide-acting enzymes are exemplified non-exclusively by enzymes with polynucleotide-cleaving activity, enzymes with polynucleotide-methylating activity, enzymes with polynucleotide-ligating activity, and enzymes with a plurality of distinguishable enzymatic activities (including non-exclusively, e.g., both polynucleotide-cleaving activity and polynucleotide-ligating activity).</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0525">Relevant polynucleotide-acting enzymes thus also include any commercially available or non-commercially available polynucleotide endonucleases and their companion methylases including those catalogued at the website http://www.neb.com/rebase, and those mentioned in the following cited reference (Roberts and Macelis, 1996). Preferred polynucleotide endonucleases include&#x2014;but are not limited to&#x2014;type II restriction enzymes (including type IIS), and include enzymes that cleave both strands of a double stranded polynucleotide (e.g. Not I, which cleaves both strands at 5&#x2032; . . . GC/GGCCGC . . . 3&#x2032;) and enzymes that cleave only one strand of a double stranded polynucleotide, i.e. enzymes that have polynucleotide-nicking activity, (e.g. N. BstNB I, which cleaves only one strand at 5&#x2032; . . . GAGTCNNNN/N . . . 3&#x2032; <?insert-start id="REI-00035"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 27)<?insert-end id="REI-00035" ?>). Relevant polynucleotide-acting enzymes also include type III restriction enzymes.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0526">It is appreciated that relevant polynucleotide-acting enzymes also include any enzymes that may be developed in the future, though currently unavailable, that are serviceable for generating a ligation compatible end, preferably a sticky end, in a polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0527">In one preferred exemplification, a serviceable selection marker is a restriction site in a polynucleotide that allows a corresponding type II (or type IIS) restriction enzyme to cleave an end of the polynucleotide so as to provide a ligatable end (including a blunt end or alternatively a sticky end with at least a one base overhang) that is serviceable for a desirable ligation reaction without cleaving the polynucleotide internally in a manner that destroys a desired internal sequence in the polynucleotide. Thus it is provided that, among relevant restriction sites, those sites that do not occur internally (i.e. that do not occur apart from the termini) in a specific working polynucleotide are preferred when the use of a corresponding restriction enzyme(s) is not intended to cut the working polynucleotide internally. This allows one to perform restriction digestion reactions to completion or to near completion without incurring unwanted internal cleavage in a working polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0528">According to a preferred aspect, it is thus preferable to use restriction sites that are not contained, or alternatively that are not expected to be contained, or alternatively that unlikely to be contained (e.g. when sequence information regarding a working polynucleotide is incomplete) internally in a polynucleotide to be subjected to end-selection. In accordance with this aspect, it is appreciated that restriction sites that occur relatively infrequently are usually preferred over those that occur more frequently. On the other hand it is also appreciated that there are occasions where internal cleavage of a polypeptide is desired, e.g. to achieve recombination or other mutagenic procedures along with end-selection.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0529">In accord with this invention, it is also appreciated that methods (e.g. mutagenesis methods) can be used to remove unwanted internal restriction sites. It is also appreciated that a partial digestion reaction (i.e. a digestion reaction that proceeds to partial completion) can be used to achieve digestion at a recognition site in a terminal region while sparing a susceptible restriction site that occurs internally in a polynucleotide and that is recognized by the same enzyme. In one aspect, partial digest are useful because it is appreciated that certain enzymes show preferential cleavage of the same recognition sequence depending on the location and environment in which the recognition sequence occurs. For example, it is appreciated that, while lambda DNA has 5 EcoR I sites, cleavage of the site nearest to the right terminus has been reported to occur 10 times faster than the sites in the middle of the molecule. Also, for example, it has been reported that, while Sac II has four sites on lambda DNA, the three clustered centrally in lambda are cleaved 50 times faster than the remaining site near the terminus (at nucleotide 40,386). Summarily, site preferences have been reported for various enzymes by many investigators (e.g., Thomas and Davis, 1975; Forsblum et al, 1976; Nath and Azzolina, 1981; Brown and Smith, 1977; Gingeras and Brooks, 1983; Kr&#xfc;ger et al, 1988; Conrad and Topal, 1989; Oller et al, 1991; Topal, 1991; and Pein, 1991; to name but a few). It is appreciated that any empirical observations as well as any mechanistic understandings of site preferences by any serviceable polynucleotide-acting enzymes, whether currently available or to be procured in the future, may be serviceable in end-selection according to this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0530">It is also appreciated that protection methods can be used to selectively protect specified restriction sites (e.g. internal sites) against unwanted digestion by enzymes that would otherwise cut a working polypeptide in response to the presence of those sites; and that such protection methods include modifications such as methylations and base substitutions (e.g. U instead of T) that inhibit an unwanted enzyme activity. It is appreciated that there are limited numbers of available restriction enzymes that are rare enough (e.g. having very long recognition sequences) to create large (e.g. megabase-long) restriction fragments, and that protection approaches (e.g. by methylation) are serviceable for increasing the rarity of enzyme cleavage sites. The use of M.Fnu II (mCGCG) to increase the apparent rarity of Not I approximately twofold is but one example among many (Qiang et al, 1990; Nelson et al, 1984; Maxam and Gilbert, 1980; Raleigh and Wilson, 1986).</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0531">According to a preferred aspect of this invention, it is provided that, in general, the use of rare restriction sites is preferred. It is appreciated that, in general, the frequency of occurrence of a restriction site is determined by the number of nucleotides contained therein, as well as by the ambiguity of the base requirements contained therein. Thus, in a non-limiting exemplification, it is appreciated that, in general, a restriction site composed of, for example, 8 specific nucleotides (e.g. the Not I site or GC/GGCCGC, with an estimated relative occurrence of 1 in 4<sup>8</sup>, i.e. 1 in 65,536, random 8-mers) is relatively more infrequent than one composed of, for example, 6 nucleotides (e.g. the Sma I site or CCC/GGG, having an estimated relative occurrence of 1 in 4<sup>6</sup>, i.e. 1 in 4,096, random 6-mers), which in turn is relatively more infrequent than one composed of, for example, 4 nucleotides (e.g. the Msp I site or C/CGG, having an estimated relative occurrence of 1 in 4<sup>4</sup>, i.e. 1 in 256, random 4-mers). Moreover, in another non-limiting exemplification, it is appreciated that, in general, a restriction site having no ambiguous (but only specific) base requirements (e.g. the Fin I site or GTCCC, having an estimated relative occurrence of 1 in 4<sup>5</sup>, i.e. 1 in 1024, random 5-mers) is relatively more infrequent than one having an ambiguous W (where W=A or T) base requirement (e.g. the Ava II site or G/GWCC, having an estimated relative occurrence of 1 in 4&#xd7;4&#xd7;2&#xd7;4&#xd7;4&#x2014;i.e. 1 in 512&#x2014;random 5-mers), which in turn is relatively more infrequent than one having an ambiguous N (where N=A or C or G or T) base requirement (e.g. the Asu I site or G/GNCC, having an estimated relative occurrence of 1 in 4&#xd7;4&#xd7;1&#xd7;4&#xd7;4, i.e. I in 256&#x2014;random 5-mers). These relative occurrences are considered general estimates for actual polynucleotides, because it is appreciated that specific nucleotide bases (not to mention specific nucleotide sequences) occur with dissimilar frequencies in specific polynucleotides, in specific species of organisms, and in specific groupings of organisms. For example, it is appreciated that the % G+C contents of different species of organisms are often very different and wide ranging.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0532">The use of relatively more infrequent restriction sites as a selection marker include&#x2014;in a non-limiting fashion&#x2014;preferably those sites composed at least a 4 nucleotide sequence, more preferably those composed at least a 5 nucleotide sequence, more preferably still those composed at least a 6 nucleotide sequence (e.g. the BamH I site or G/GATCC, the Bgl II site or A/GATCT, the Pst I site or CTGCA/G, and the Xba I site or T/CTAGA), more preferably still those composed at least a 7 nucleotide sequence, more preferably still those composed of an 8 nucleotide sequence nucleotide sequence (e.g. the Asc I site or GG/CGCGCC, the Not I site or GC/GGCCGC, the Pac-I site or TTAAT/TAA, the Pme I site or GTTT/AAAC, the Srf I site or GCCC/GGGC, the Sse838 I site or CCTGCA/GG, and the Swa I site or ATTT/AAAT), more preferably still those composed of a 9 nucleotide sequence, and even more preferably still those composed of at least a 10 nucleotide sequence (e.g. the BspG I site or CG/CGCTGGAC <?insert-start id="REI-00036"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 28)<?insert-end id="REI-00036" ?>). It is further appreciated that some restriction sites (e.g. for class IIS enzymes) are comprised of a portion of relatively high specificity (i.e. a portion containing a principal determinant of the frequency of occurrence of the restriction site) and a portion of relatively low specificity; and that a site of cleavage may or may not be contained within a portion of relatively low specificity. For example, in the Eco57 I site or CTGAAG(16/14) <?insert-start id="REI-00037"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 24)<?insert-end id="REI-00037" ?>, there is a portion of relatively high specificity (i.e. the CTGAAG portion) and a portion of relatively low specificity (i.e. the N16 sequence) that contains a site of cleavage.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0533">In another preferred embodiment of this invention, a serviceable end-selection marker is a terminal sequence that is recognized by a polynucleotide-acting enzyme that recognizes a specific polynucleotide sequence. In a preferred aspect of this invention, serviceable polynucleotide-acting enzymes also include other enzymes in addition to classic type II restriction enzymes. According to this preferred aspect of this invention, serviceable polynucleotide-acting enzymes also include gyrases, helicases, recombinases, relaxases, and any enzymes related thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0534">Among preferred examples are topoisomerases (which have been categorized by some as a subset of the gyrases) and any other enzymes that have polynucleotide-cleaving activity (including preferably polynucleotide-nicking activity) &#x26;/or polynucleotide-ligating activity. Among preferred topoisomerase enzymes are topoisomerase I enzymes, which is available from many commercial sources (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, Wis.; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.; Life Technologies, <?delete-start id="REI-00038"  date="20150120" ?>Gathesburg<?delete-end id="REI-00038" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00039"  date="20150120" ?>Gaithersburg<?insert-end id="REI-00039" ?>, Md.) and conceivably even more private sources. It is appreciated that similar enzymes may be developed in the future that are serviceable for end-selection as provided herein. A particularly preferred topoisomerase I enzyme is a topoisomerase I enzyme of vaccinia virus origin, that has a specific recognition sequence (e.g. 5&#x2032; . . . AAGGG . . . 3&#x2032;) and has both polynucleotide-nicking activity and polynucleotide-ligating activity. Due to the specific nicking-activity of this enzyme (cleavage of one strand), internal recognition sites are not prone to polynucleotide destruction resulting from the nicking activity (but rather remain annealed) at a temperature that causes denaturation of a terminal site that has been nicked. Thus for use in end-selection, it is preferable that a nicking site for topoisomerase-based end-selection be no more than 100 nucleotides from a terminus, more preferably no more than 50 nucleotides from a terminus, more preferably still no more than 25 <?delete-start id="REI-00040"  date="20150120" ?>nucloetides<?delete-end id="REI-00040" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00041"  date="20150120" ?>nucleotides <?insert-end id="REI-00041" ?>from a terminus, even more preferably still no more than 20 nucleotides from a terminus, even more preferably still no more than 15 nucleotides from a terminus, even more preferably still no more than 10 nucleotides from a terminus, even more preferably still no more than 8 nucleotides from a terminus, even more preferably still no more than 6 nucleotides from a terminus, and even more preferably still no more than 4 nucleotides from a terminus.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0535">In a particularly preferred exemplification that is non-limiting yet clearly illustrative, it is appreciated that when a nicking site for topoisomerase-based end-selection is 4 nucleotides from a terminus, nicking produces a single stranded oligo of 4 bases (in a terminal region) that can be denatured from its complementary strand in an end-selectable polynucleotide; this provides a sticky end (comprised of 4 bases) in a polynucleotide that is serviceable for an ensuing ligation reaction. To accomplish ligation to a cloning vector (preferably an expression vector), compatible sticky ends can be generated in a cloning vector by any means including by restriction enzyme-based means. The terminal nucleotides (comprised of 4 terminal bases in this specific example) in an end-selectable polynucleotide terminus are thus wisely chosen to provide compatibility with a sticky end generated in a cloning vector to which the polynucleotide is to be ligated.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0536">On the other hand, internal nicking of an end-selectable polynucleotide, e.g. 500 bases from a terminus, produces a single stranded oligo of 500 bases that is not easily denatured from its complementary strand, but rather is serviceable for repair (e.g. by the same topoisomerase enzyme that produced the nick).</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0537">This invention thus provides a method&#x2014;e.g. that is vaccinia topoisomerase-based &#x26;/or type II (or IIS) restriction endonuclease-based &#x26;/or type III restriction endonuclease-based &#x26;/or nicking enzyme-based (e.g. using N. BstNB I)&#x2014;for producing a sticky end in a working polynucleotide, which end is ligation compatible, and which end can be comprised of at least a 1 base overhang. Preferably such a sticky end is comprised of at least a 2-base overhang, more preferably such a sticky end is comprised of at least a 3-base overhang, more preferably still such a sticky end is comprised of at least a 4-base overhang, even more preferably still such a sticky end is comprised of at least a 5-base overhang, even more preferably still such a sticky end is comprised of at least a 6-base overhang. Such a sticky end may also be comprised of at least a 7-base overhang, or at least an 8-base overhang, or at least a 9-base overhang, or at least a 10-base overhang, or at least 15-base overhang, or at least a 20-base overhang, or at least a 25-base overhang, or at least a 30-base overhang. These overhangs can be comprised of any bases, including A, C, G, or T.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0538">It is appreciated that sticky end overhangs introduced using topoisomerase or a nicking enzyme (e.g. using N. BstNB I) can be designed to be unique in a ligation environment, so as to prevent unwanted fragment reassemblies, such as self-dimerizations and other unwanted concatamerizations.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0539">According to one aspect of this invention, a plurality of sequences (which may but do not necessarily overlap) can be introduced into a terminal region of an end-selectable polynucleotide by the use of an oligo in a polymerase-based reaction. In a relevant, but by no means limiting example, such an oligo can be used to provide a preferred 5&#x2032; terminal region that is serviceable for topoisomerase I-based end-selection, which oligo is comprised of: a 1-10 base sequence that is convertible into a sticky end (preferably by a vaccinia topoisomerase 1), a ribosome binding site (i.e. and &#x201c;RBS&#x201d;, that is preferably serviceable for expression cloning), and optional linker sequence followed by an ATG start site and a template-specific sequence of 0-100 bases (to facilitate annealment to the template in a polymerase-based reaction). Thus, according to this example, a serviceable oligo (which may be termed a forward primer) can have the sequence: 5&#x2032;[terminal sequence=(N)<sub>1-10</sub>][topoisomerase I site &#x26; RBS=AAGGGAGGAG][linker=(N)<sub>1-110</sub>][start codon and template-specific sequence=ATG(N)<sub>0-100</sub>]3&#x2032; <?insert-start id="REI-00042"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 29)<?insert-end id="REI-00042" ?>.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0540">Analogously, in a relevant, but by no means limiting example, an oligo can be used to provide a preferred 3&#x2032; terminal region that is serviceable for topoisomerase I-based end-selection, which oligo is comprised of: a 1-10 base sequence that is convertible into a sticky end (preferably by a vaccinia topoisomerase I), and optional linker sequence followed by a template-specific sequence of 0-100 bases (to facilitate annealment to the template in a polymerase-based reaction). Thus, according to this example, a serviceable oligo (which may be termed a reverse primer) can have the sequence: 5&#x2032;[terminal sequence=(N)<sub>1-10</sub>][topoisomerase I site=AAGGG][linker=(N)<sub>1-100</sub>][template-specific sequence=(N)<sub>1-100</sub>]3&#x2032; <?insert-start id="REI-00043"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 30)<?insert-end id="REI-00043" ?>.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0541">It is appreciated that, end-selection can be used to distinguish and separate parental template molecules (e.g. to be subjected to mutagenesis) from progeny molecules (e.g. generated by mutagenesis). For example, a first set of primers, lacking in a topoisomerase I recognition site, can be used to modify the terminal regions of the parental molecules (e.g. in polymerase-based amplification). A different second set of primers (e.g. having a topoisomerase I recognition site) can then be used to generate mutated progeny molecules (e.g. using any polynucleotide chimerization method, such as interrupted synthesis, template-switching polymerase-based amplification, or interrupted synthesis; or using saturation mutagenesis; or using any other method for introducing a topoisomerase I recognition site into a mutagenized progeny molecule as disclosed herein) from the amplified template molecules. The use of topoisomerase I-based end-selection can then facilitate, not only discernment, but selective topoisomerase I-based ligation of the desired progeny molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0542">Annealment of a second set of primers to thusly amplified parental molecules can be facilitated by including sequences in a first set of primers (i.e. primers used for amplifying a set parental molecules) that are similar to a toposiomerase I recognition site, yet different enough to prevent functional toposiomerase I enzyme recognition. For example, sequences that diverge from the AAGGG site by anywhere from 1 base to all 5 bases can be incorporated into a first set of primers (to be used for amplifying the parental templates prior to subjection to mutagenesis). In a specific, but non-limiting aspect, it is thus provided that a parental molecule can be amplified using the following exemplary&#x2014;but by no means limiting&#x2014;set of forward and reverse primers:

<p id="p-0435" num="0546">According to a specific, but non-limiting aspect, it is thus provided that, after this amplification (using a disclosed first set of primers lacking in a true topoisomerase I recognition site), amplified parental molecules can then be subjected to mutagenesis using one or more sets of forward and reverse primers that do have a true topoisomerase I recognition site. In a specific, but non-limiting aspect, it is thus provided that a parental molecule can be used as templates for the generation of a mutagenized progeny molecule using the following exemplary&#x2014;but by no means limiting&#x2014;second set of forward and reverse primers:

</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0549">It is appreciated that any number of different primers sets not specifically mentioned can be used as first, second, or subsequent sets of primers for end-selection consistent with this invention. Notice that type II restriction enzyme sites can be incorporated (e.g. an Asc I site in the above example). It is provided that, in addition to the other sequences mentioned, the experimentalist can incorporate one or more N,N,G/T triplets into a serviceable primer in order to subject a working polynucleotide to saturation mutagenesis. Summarily, use of a second and/or subsequent set of primers can achieve dual goals of introducing a topoisomerase I site and of generating mutations in a progeny polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0437" num="0550">Thus, according to one use provided, a serviceable end-selection marker is an enzyme recognition site that allows an enzyme to cleave (including nick) a polynucleotide at a specified site, to produce a ligation-compatible end upon denaturation of a generated single stranded oligo. Ligation of the produced polynucleotide end can then be accomplished by the same enzyme (e.g. in the case of vaccinia virus topoisomerase I), or alternatively with the use of a different enzyme. According to one aspect of this invention, any serviceable end-selection markers, whether like (e.g. two vaccinia virus topoisomerase I recognition sites) or unlike (e.g. a class II restriction enzyme recognition site and a vaccinia virus topoisomerase I recognition site) can be used in combination to select a polynucleotide. Each selectable polynucleotide can thus have one or more end-selection markers, and they can be like or unlike end-selection markers. In a particular aspect, a plurality of end-selection markers can be located on one end of a polynucleotide and can have overlapping sequences with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0438" num="0551">It is important to emphasize that any number of enzymes, whether currently in existence or to be developed, can be serviceable in end-selection according to this invention. For example, in a particular aspect of this invention, a nicking enzyme (e.g. N. BstNB I, which cleaves only one strand at 5&#x2032; . . . GAGTCNNNN/N . . . 3&#x2032; <?insert-start id="REI-00048"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 27)<?insert-end id="REI-00048" ?>) can be used in conjunction with a source of polynucleotide-ligating activity in order to achieve end-selection. According to this embodiment, a recognition site for N. BstNB I&#x2014;instead of a recognition site for topoisomerase I&#x2014;should be incorporated into an end-selectable polynucleotide (whether end-selection is used for selection of a mutagenized progeny molecule or whether end-selection is used apart from any mutagenesis procedure).</p>
<p id="p-0439" num="0552">It is appreciated that the instantly disclosed end-selection approach using topoisomerase-based nicking and ligation has several advantages over previously available selection methods. In sum, this approach allows one to achieve direction cloning (including expression cloning). Specifically, this approach can be used for the achievement of: direct ligation (i.e. without subjection to a classic restriction-purification-ligation reaction, that is susceptible to a multitude of potential problems from an initial restriction reaction to a ligation reaction dependent on the use of T4 DNA ligase); separation of progeny molecules from original template molecules (e.g. original template molecules lack topoisomerase I sites that not introduced until after mutagenesis), obviation of the need for size separation steps (e.g. by gel chromatography or by other electrophoretic means or by the use of size-exclusion membranes), preservation of internal sequences (even when topoisomerase I sites are present), obviation of concerns about unsuccessful ligation reactions (e.g. dependent on the use of T4 DNA ligase, particularly in the presence of unwanted residual restriction enzyme activity), and facilitated expression cloning (including obviation of frame shift concerns). Concerns about unwanted restriction enzyme-based cleavages&#x2014;especially at internal restriction sites (or even at often unpredictable sites of unwanted star activity) in a working polynucleotide&#x2014;that are potential sites of destruction of a working polynucleotide can also be obviated by the instantly disclosed end-selection approach using topoisomerase-based nicking and ligation.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Two-Hybrid Based Screening Assays</p>
<p id="p-0440" num="0553">Shuffling can also be used to recombinatorially diversify a pool of selected library members obtained by screening a two-hybrid screening system to identify library members which bind a predetermined polypeptide sequence. The selected library members are pooled and shuffled by in vitro and/or in vivo recombination. The shuffled pool can then be screened in a yeast two hybrid system to select library members which bind said predetermined polypeptide sequence (e. g., and SH2 domain) or which bind an alternate predetermined polypeptide sequence (e.g., an SH2 domain from another protein species).</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0554">An approach to identifying polypeptide sequences which bind to a predetermined polypeptide sequence has been to use a so-called &#x201c;two-hybrid&#x201d; system wherein the predetermined polypeptide sequence is present in a fusion protein (Chien et al, 1991). This approach identifies protein-protein interactions in vivo through reconstitution of a transcriptional activator (Fields and Song, 1989), the yeast Gal4 transcription protein. Typically, the method is based on the properties of the yeast Gal4 protein, which consists of separable domains responsible for DNA-binding and transcriptional activation. Polynucleotides encoding two hybrid proteins, one consisting of the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to a polypeptide sequence of a known protein and the other consisting of the Gal4 activation domain fused to a polypeptide sequence of a second protein, are constructed and introduced into a yeast host cell. Intermolecular binding between the two fusion proteins reconstitutes the Gal4 DNA-binding domain with the Gal4 activation domain, which leads to the transcriptional activation of a reporter gene (e.g., lacz, HIS3) which is operably linked to a Gal4 binding site. Typically, the two-hybrid method is used to identify novel polypeptide sequences which interact with a known protein (Silver and Hunt, 1993; Durfee et al, 1993; Yang et al, 1992; Luban et al, 1993; Hardy et al, 1992; Bartel et al, 1993; and Vojtek et al, 1993). However, variations of the two-hybrid method have been used to identify mutations of a known protein that affect its binding to a second known protein (Li and Fields, 1993; Lalo et al, 1993; Jackson et al, 1993; and Madura et al, 1993). Two-hybrid systems have also been used to identify interacting structural domains of two known proteins (Bardwell et al, 1993; Chakrabarty et al, 1992; Staudinger et al, 1993; and Milne and Weaver 1993) or domains responsible for oligomerization of a single protein (Iwabuchi et al, 1993; Bogerd et al, 1993). Variations of two-hybrid systems have been used to study the in vivo activity of a proteolytic enzyme (Dasmahapatra et al, 1992). Alternatively, an E. coli/BCCP interactive screening system (Germino et al, 1993; Guarente, 1993) can be used to identify interacting protein sequences (i.e., protein sequences which heterodimerize or form higher order heteromultimers). Sequences selected by a two-hybrid system can be pooled and shuffled and introduced into a two-hybrid system for one or more subsequent rounds of screening to identify polypeptide sequences which bind to the hybrid containing the predetermined binding sequence. The sequences thus identified can be compared to identify consensus sequence(s) and consensus sequence kernals.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0555">In general, standard techniques of recombination DNA technology are described in various publications (e.g. Sambrook et al, 1989; Ausubel et al, 1987; and Berger and Kimmel, 1987) each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Polynucleotide modifying enzymes were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Inc. Model 394 DNA synthesizer using ABI chemicals. If desired, PCR amplimers for amplifying a predetermined DNA sequence may be selected at the discretion of the practitioner.</p>

One method for identifying hybrid polypeptides that possess a desired structure or functional property, such as binding to a predetermined biological macromolecule (e.g., a receptor), involves the screening of a large library of polypeptides for individual library members which possess the desired structure or functional property conferred by the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide.</p>

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0458" num="0595">Following this procedure nine single site mutations appeared to confer increased thermal stability on the enzyme. Sequence analysis was performed to determine of the exact amino acid changes at each position that were specifically responsible for the improvement. In sum, the improvement was conferred at 7 sites by one amino acid change alone, at an eighth site by each of two amino acid changes, and at a ninth site by each of three amino acid changes. Several mutants were then made each having a plurality of these nine beneficial site mutations in combination; of these two mutants proved superior to all the other mutants, including those with single point mutations.</p>

<p id="p-0472" num="0625">Thermal stability was assessed by incubating the enzyme at the elevated temperature (55&#xb0; C. and 80&#xb0; C.) for some period of time and activity assay at 30&#xb0; C. Initial rates were plotted vs. time at the higher temperature. The enzyme was in 50 mM Tris/SO<sub>4 </sub>pH 7.8 for both the incubation and the assay. Product (Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) was detected by a standard method using Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>and HgSCN. Dhla 20F12 was used as the defacto wild type.

<p id="p-0473" num="0626">According to another aspect of this invention, ligation reassembly can be performed using a solid support. The following example 8 (corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) is illustrative but non-limiting.</p>
<heading id="h-0037" level="1">EXAMPLE 8</heading>
<heading id="h-0038" level="1">Solid Phase Gene Family Reassembly Protocol</heading>
<p id="p-0474" num="0627">The objective can be, e.g., to reassemble/shuffle molecules of DNA to generate gene libraries of specific genes, libraries of gene families, and libraries of unrelated genes. The synthesis of the full-length molecules is carried out on a solid support. As solid support we use paramagnetic beads coated with Streptavidin. The principle is based on the strong interaction between Biotin and Streptavidin and the ability to stepwise or <?delete-start id="REI-00061"  date="20150120" ?>simulataneously<?delete-end id="REI-00061" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00062"  date="20150120" ?>simultaneously <?insert-end id="REI-00062" ?>ligate DNA fragments generated from the annealing of nucleic acid building blocks (such as ssDNA building blocks). The use of a solid support facilitates the reassembly of nucleic acid building blocks in a sequential manner and thus allows one to use not only unique couplings, but also redundant or repeated couplings throughout the length of a nucleic acid molecule that is to be generated by ligation reassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0628">A &#x201c;capture oligonucleotide&#x201d; is biotinylated at the 5&#x2032; end for binding to the beads. The &#x201c;capture oligo&#x201d; is annealed to a complementary sequence (no biotinylated). The double stranded capture fragment contains two restriction sites at the 5&#x2032;-end which allows release of the assembled molecules from the solid support.</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0629">Ligation reassembly is performed by step-wise ligation of annealed oligonucleotides of 20-100 bases. The first fragment of the assembly contains a 5&#x2032;-end compatible with the 3&#x2032;-end of the capture biotinylated fragment. Consecutive ligation of double stranded fragments containing complementary ends allows the generation of full-length molecules. Half way synthesis (midpoint) molecules are released from the solid support. A final ligation step between molecules generated from both ends results in the generation a full-length reassembled DNA.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There is an ever-increasing demand for native hardwoods, but commercial farming of this class of trees is frustrated by the slow growth of this class of trees and the difficulty in transplanting them. Similarly, non-commercial reforestation with hardwoods is frustrated by the slow growth and transplantation difficulties. &#x201c;Traditional&#x201d; production methods for native hardwoods such as Oaks, Hickories, Ash, Nut trees and others are notoriously slow growing and tend to develop a coarse, carrot-like dominant tap root which makes them very difficult to transplant both in the nursery and especially in out-planting situations&#x2014;where mortality rates often ran as high as 70 percent or more.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To try and overcome the problems associated with transplantability of native hardwoods and other difficult to transplant species, many nurseries began to &#x201c;root-prune&#x201d; their plants while in the field one to three years prior to sale in hopes of developing a &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; root system which would give this class of plants a better chance of surviving the out-planting process. The major problem associated with root-pruning in the field is that it not only &#x201c;shocks&#x201d; the plants because its root system has been severed but also halts growth and forces the grower to &#x201c;wait&#x201d; for another year or more for the root system to re-develop. Although the process of root pruning in the field greatly helped to minimize loss after out-planting, the process was slow, costly and extended the time a plant must remain in the nursery.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The method of the present invention involves consideration of seed selection, including seed origin (provenance, density, and size). It further involves consideration of seed handling including stratification, timing of germination to extend growing season, technique (depth) of seeding. It further involves air pruning, preferably in two steps using air as a means of root pruning to enhance the development of a dense fibrous root mass. It further involves gradation for uniformity of stock and to reduce transplanting losses. Lastly, the method involves selection of growing media, including fertilizer, consideration of air space, wetting agents, and components. The method of the present invention accelerates rate of growth, and induces early flowering and fruiting.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Seed selection is an important component in the acceleration of tree growth. Special attention is provided to assure seed is selected from superior individual parents, showing outstanding phenotype, typical of the particular specie or variety of tree. Attention also must be focused on the climate zone of origin, including attitude and locations within its native geographical range, normally referred to as &#x201c;provenance&#x201d;. Within a given provenance, seed is selected based on environmental conditions of the final location. It is desirable to select seed from the same species growing in the same environmental conditions, e.g., a flood plain or an upland site. Seed is collected site specific. These different types of seed are referred to as ecotypes. Proper selection results in tree improvement, superior adaption to planting sites all of which add to economic and aesthetic value.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Seed handling is also an important component in the acceleration of tree growth. Collected seed are processed by cleaning out any foreign materials. They are then processed through an aspirator to separate out the heaviest individual seed. Density is the most important factor in germination capacity of any seed, and survival of the seedling. Density is a measure of the stored food reserve. After the heaviest seed are selected they are then processed through a sieve which grades them by size, e.g. three (3) or four (4) different sizes. Only the largest, heaviest seed are used. Since these factors (weight, size, and density) are genetic in nature these processes have definite effects on the genetic improvement of the progeny.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Seed stratification and timing are also important in the acceleration of tree growth. The length of time required for stratification is predetermined so germination can start (For example February 1st.) Thus the seed must be handled in such a manor that all stratification requirements are satisfied prior to February 1st. Thus, for example, a seed requiring ninety (90) days of cold stratification would have to be placed in our cold storage November 1st, so that it could be germinated by February 1st. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the seed is preferably pre-sown in the stratification media (which is preferably the same as growing medium, described below) and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>, the seeded trays are stacked in a cold storage room where temperature is maintained at 32&#xb0; F. The seed are placed on the surface of the growing medium. When germination begins, the outer seed coat splits exposing the seed cotyledons. When exposed to light the cotyledons turn from their normal pure white to green, indicating they are photosynthesizing and producing additional energy for the germinating seedling. The inventors' research shows that most of the energy produced by the seed's cotyledons goes to the production of the plants root system, thus adding to the primary goal of producing and enhancing an improved root system. This is in contrast to the established conventional rule that the depth of seed planting should be twice the diameter of the seed. The 32 temperature will prevent pre-germination of seed once its ripening requirements have been satisfied. This 32&#xb0; F. temperature is also in contrast to the established convention wisdom of temperatures between about 37&#xb0; F. to 41&#xb0; F. Still another difference from conventional methods is placing the seeds in growing media. Historically seeds have been stratified separately and then seeded immediately prior to germinating.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The timing of the above steps in the method is based on having the seedlings processed through termination, Step I root pruning, grading, and Step II transplanting, so they are ready for planting outdoors by the frost free date (approximately May 10 in Missouri). This gives the seedlings the maximum growing period until the first fall frost, approximately 210 growing days. A time sequence might be: February 1st&#x2014;start germination in greenhouse at a temperature of between 68&#xb0; F. and 72&#xb0; F. for about thirty days, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. March 1st transplant to square deep bottomless containers for additional air pruning of the lateral roots produced in the seed flat pruning. Containers 2&#xbe;&#xd7;2&#xbe;&#xd7;3 inch have been used satisfactorily for this step, but the inventors have determined that containers 3 9/16&#xd7;3 9/16&#xd7;4&#xbc; inch produce superior plants as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. At the end of Step II, the seedlings are between 12 inches and 18 inches in height and are ready to be planted in their final growing container outside in a nursery production area.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As described above, the seeding is done by placing seed on a bottomless mesh seed flat. While seed flats measuring 18&#xbd; inches&#xd7;14&#xbd; inches&#xd7;2&#xbd; inches deep with mesh spacing of &#x215c; inches have been used satisfactorily, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, seed flats measuring 15&#xbe; inches&#xd7;15&#xbe; inches&#xd7;5 inches deep with mesh spacing of &#x215c; inches (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) have been found to be optimum. A soil-less seeding medium and growing medium is preferably used. The seeding medium consists of 40% composted rice hulls, 40% pine bark, 20% sand, which results in a desirable 35% air space has been used satisfactorily, but a medium of 35% composted rice hulls, 35% pine bark, 20% sand, and 10% manure, which results in a desirable 35% air space has been found to be optimum. A complete slow release fertilizer plus micro-nutrients and a wetting agent are added to the medium. The growing medium is also inoculated with mycorrhizae spores which germinate and grow on and inside the tree roots in a symbiotic relationship (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>). Research has proven these fungi play an extremely important function on trees. They provide an immune system for the trees, blocking infectious diseases. They form such a dense mass they are able to enhance the capability of the root surface up to 1,000 times further enhancing the uptake of moisture, nutrients, and air resulting in a plant that can withstand greater stress situations and still perform and grow, displaying exceptional vigor.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">There is a universal problem of proper nutrient uptake by woody plants in artificial (soil-less) growing media. Through analysis of the media compared to the analysis of the leaves from plants grown in media for <i>Quercus bicolor</i>&#x2014;Swamp White Oak, the inventors have determined that the addition of 10% composted manure to the growing media of composted rice hulls, pine bark, and sand plus slow release fertilizer and minor trace nutrient improves the nutrient level in the plants, with most of the nutrients moving from a low interpretation in the soil medium to a desired level within the plant resulting in maximum plant growth and performance.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The addition of manure promotes the development of a balanced biological atmosphere within the growing media, promoting the growth of numerous beneficial organisms. These organisms help promote the development of desirable soil fauna that break down organic matter releasing essential bi-products (enzymes etc.) that benefit the plant by enabling uptake of nutrients that are present in the media here-to-fore but not available in a form the plant can absorb. This resulted in a reduced fertilizer rate of 50%, resulting in substantial cost savings. Also there is less impact on the environment because of fewer nutrients leaching and run off while still achieving maximum plant growth.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The inventors have also discovered that the incorporation of &#xbe; of a pound of Talstar systemic insecticide in each cubic yard of growing media trans locates throughout the plants system, helps plants grown in the media to ward off attack by a number of undesirable insect pests including but not limited to Japanese beetle.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, in the first air-pruning step, seeded flats are placed on raised greenhouse benches with air circulating beneath the benches. As germination of the seed begins to occur in the above-described bottomless flat, the following sequence occurs. The seedling radical (tap root) penetrates down through the media and emerges through the &#x215c; inch mesh, coming into contact with air circulating beneath the raised bench (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). The root tip is killed (dried) by the air, at a depth of 3 inches. Compare <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, showing a conventionally grown pecan seedling, with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> showing a pecan seedling grown in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The shallow air pruning achieved with the method of the present invention induces rapid lateral root development high (where most desired) on the tree root collar where their function to the welfare of the tree will be best served.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">This root pruning preferably occurs at about 2&#xbd;-3 inches. Extensive research conducted by the inventors has established that the ideal depth for the first air root pruning (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>) is about 3 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, in the second air-pruning step, graded seedlings are transplanted into a bottomless band measuring 3 9/16&#xd7;3 9/16&#xd7;4&#xbc; inches. This size band has been found to give improved growth and improves the root distribution in the production container. The Step II transplanted seedling bottomless bands are placed on raised bottomless benches to promote additional air pruning, which occurs on secondary lateral roots further enhancing the development of a shallow dense root mass with many root tips. The first two steps are timed so the bands are ready to be transplanted outside in the container production area during early May to avoid late frosts, but timed to take advantage of a full growing season. Timing is further important because if properly handled it can coincide with the tree setting a temporary terminal bud. When this occurs, photosynthate is trans located from the leaves down to the roots. This promotes very active root development, thus quick establishment in the container area resulting in accelerated growth.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The inventors' research also determined that the optimum size of the container for Step II is a bottomless tree band measuring 3 9/16 inches&#xd7;3 9/16 inches&#xd7;4&#xbc; inches deep (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>) produces the ideal root mass to top (all of plant above soil) ratio.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">This shallow air pruning is unique to the method of this invention, and enhances the root system resulting in the production of a superior plant that can survive, perform, and grow faster under every condition tested. Prior root pruning methods typically prune at least 5 inches or more. The shallower air pruning of the present invention induces rapid lateral root development high on the tree root collar, where most desirable, and where their function to the welfare of the tree will be best served.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The inventors have also tested various bench heights (i.e., the height from the greenhouse floor to the wire mesh supports) under a strictly controlled greenhouse environment, for both the first and second air root pruning steps. Heights of 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 inches were all carefully tested. While there was little differences in the 30 and 36 inches bench heights, both were far superior in air flow and subsequent root pruning to 12, 18, and 24 inches. As a result, the inventors have determined that balancing effectiveness of root pruning versus construction and installation costs, and ergonomic considerations, a height of 30 inches is optimum.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The seedlings are graded to identify the genetically superior individuals. Experience and research has proven that selecting the largest seedlings after their first flush of growth identifies those individuals that will remain dominant, grow faster, and exhibit genetic superiority when grown to a larger size and eventually out planted. When grading, particular attention is given to the combination of height, caliper, and root development. On most species of woody plants the top 50% are retained and transplanted and the remaining plants are discarded. This grading process has proven to be a significant step in tree improvement.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The graded seedlings are then transplanted into a bottomless band measuring 2&#x215e;&#x2033;&#xd7;2&#x215e;&#x2033;&#xd7;3&#xbe;&#x2033; in depth. (This short band gives improved growth and improves the root distribution in the production container.) The transplanted seedlings in the bottomless bands are placed on raised bottomless benches to promote additional air pruning, which occurs on secondary lateral roots further enhancing the development of a shallow dense root mass with many root tips. The first two steps are timed so the plants are ready to be transplanted outside in the container production area immediately after the last frost date (early May in Missouri) to avoid late frosts, but timed to maximize the growing season. It is also desirable to coordinate transplantation outside with the tree's setting a temporary terminal bud. When this occurs, photosynthate is trans-located from the leaves down to the roots. This promotes very active root development, and thus quick establishment in the container resulting in accelerated growth.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, while in the greenhouse, the bands are preferably contained in bottomless flats each holding 25 tree bands. When preparing to transplant out of doors plants must be handled in a special manner to make the proper transition from a controlled greenhouse environment to a more stressful outdoor environment. The greenhouse process conditions the stomata (openings on the underside of the leaf) to lose their elasticity and they are unable to narrow or close and control transpiration (water loss) and the cuticle, a waxy layer that forms on the leaf surface and protects the leaves has not formed. Both of these conditions correct themselves in 48 hours when placed outdoors in full sunlight. During this period they are intermittently misted to relieve stress while becoming acclimated. After becoming acclimated they are moved to a container production area (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>), and transplanted into existing pre-filled containers (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). A shallow wide growing container is used, because most of the feeder roots remain in the upper six to eight inches of soil after out-planting. The growing container measures 10 inches across and 7 inches deep (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). This allows 25% more lateral root development than a smaller size previously used. This production system results in growth to a marketable size in one growing season of approximately 210 days from date of seed germination (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the root mass achieved with the methods of the present invention eliminates losses often experienced using conventionally grown trees, especially those recognized to be difficult to transplant, such as Oak, Hickories, Ash, and Nut Trees. Using the methods of this invention, the inventors have achieved consistent survival rates greater than 95%, even at very stressful sites such as wetlands, (where flooding occurs), mine reclamation sites, and construction sites.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The trees produced with the method of this invention grow an average of three times faster than conventionally grown seedlings. As show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref>, <b>25</b>, and <b>26</b>, even after 15 years, the trees grow at 3 times the rate of conventionally produced trees. This accelerated growth rate greatly increases the value and economics of tree farming. Using the methods of this invention, the rate of turnover in most tree production could be increased by 50% or more and make tree farming a profitable and viable growing enterprise.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Most varieties of trees grown under this production system have exhibited early flowering and fruiting characteristics. Examples are Swamp White Oak (<i>Quercus bicolor</i>) and Bur Oak (<i>Quercus macrocarpa</i>). It is generally accepted in the literature that these species begin flowering and fruiting at about 20 to 25 years of age. See, Schopmeyer, Seeds of Wood Plants in the United States, Agriculture Handbook No. 450, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C., Table 2 (1974), incorporated herein by reference. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref> trees of these species grown in accordance with the methods of the present invention have consistently produced fruit in the 3rd year after out-planting. The inventors believe that these plants have as many root tips (where the hormones are produced) as naturally grown 20 to 25 year old trees. This fast fruiting is very valuable from a regeneration and wildlife food standpoint. The inventors' research indicates this same response occurs in both nut trees and fruit trees, specifically pecans, walnuts and apples.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Specific differences between the method of the present invention, and prior methods of tree production include: (1) the shallow depth of air pruning (about 2&#xbd;&#x2033;); (2) seed grading to select genetically superior seeds; (3) transplantation after the first root pruning to bottomless bands to further increase root mass, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>17</b>, and <b>28</b>; (4) the shallow depth of the bottomless band compared to conventional deeper containers that accommodated the tap roots 3 9/16 inches&#xd7;3 9/16 inches&#xd7;4&#xbc; inches; (5) the growing medium (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) that combines the proper amounts of air, nutrients, and beneficial natural soil born organisms in balance with an enhanced root system that properly utilizes and assimilates them, the result is greatly accelerated growth rates that persists for years; (6) high transplantability and survival of trees produced with the method of this invention, which is nearly 100% survival when out-planted under virtually all conditions, and greater than 95% plus on stressed sites where conventional produced seedlings survived at rates of 2% or less. Sites tested include wetlands that are repeatedly flooded, strip mine reclamation, and other problem planting sites and conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The inventors have propagated approximately 750,000 containerized oak and nut tree seedlings per year, many of which have been out-planted on abandoned mine lands, old wetland sites and fields in central and western Missouri. First-year establishment success for containerized seedlings is approximately twice the success of bare-root seedlings in side-by-side field trials. Greatest mortality resulted from excessive competing vegetation and rodent damage in winter. Tap-rooted hardwoods such as oak, hickory, and walnut responded well to air-pruning, which resulted from using bottomless containers. Seedlings were propagated and placed upon a raised, welded hog or cattle panel, with four-inch squares, protected from squirrels by a wood frame and chicken wire.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Qualitative observation of establishment success suggests a first-season survival rate of 90 percent for air-pruned bur oak and pecan grown in half-gallon bottomless containers. This compares to 40 to 50 percent survival of year old bare-root stock grown at a local nursery. These were side-by-side trials of seedlings planted in prepared rows of prairie soils in Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) crop fields in western Missouri. Rows were set at 15-foot centers, disked, and planted by hand. Containerized seedlings were planted in fall, and bare-root seedlings were planted in spring. Success rates were slightly higher in very fine sandy loam soils mapped as Bates loam, (2 to 5 percent slopes, fine-loamy, siliceous, therrvic (Typic Argiudolls) compared to silty clay soils mapped as Kenoma (2 to 5 percent slopes, fine, montmorillinitic, thermic Vertic Argiudolls) (USDA 1995). Competition became intense in mid-summer as late-season weeds such as common and giant ragweed; cocklebur and begger ticks germinated from the old-field seedbank. The rows were mowed in July to prevent shading of the seedlings.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A second test plot was established on rough-graded, neutral mine spoils (silty clay texture with 15 percent shale charmers, 5 percent sandstone pebbles and few sandstone cobbles) in western Missouri. Establishment success in the first season was approximately 75 percent for containerized bur oak and pecan compared to 30 percent for bare-root seedlings. Compaction was minimal since all grading was performed by a D-3 dozer knocking the tops off the spoil-ridges, pushing the fill into the valleys between ridges. Wind-disseminated species, particularly broomsedge, slowly colonized the plots, competing with the seedlings. Adjacent mine spoils were heavily vegetated, enabling deer to browse the plot undisturbed.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A third test plot was established in central Missouri on loess-derived forest soils that had been cleared in the 19th century, farmed and planted to tall fescue in recent decades. In places, much of the A horizon had been eroded and mixed by plowing into the E horizon. The soils were classified as eroded Winfield silt roam (fine-silty mixed mesic. Typic Hapludalfs) (USDA 1994). Fescue sod was removed with a heavy hoe around each seedling to reduce competition at the time of establishment. Spraying also is effective; but the seedlings should be dormant. First-year success rates for containerized bur and northern red oak were 90 percent compared to 25 percent for bare-root.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The following table shows a hypothetical cost/benefit analysis of plants grown in accordance with the principles of the present invention versus conventional bare root plants,</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the field of immunogenic compositions for the prevention of HIV infection.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">More than 60 million people worldwide have been infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and nearly half have died of the resultant Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) since 1981. About 2.7 million new infections were reported in 2007. Therefore, development of an effective and safe HIV vaccine is urgently needed to contain the spread of HIV and AIDS. However, most previous efforts to achieve this goal have failed. Clinical trials of the first T-cell vaccine (Merck's MRKAd5 HIV-1 gag/pol/nef trivalent vaccine) were terminated recently because the data showed that the vaccine was unable to prevent HIV infection and could not lower virus levels in vaccinated volunteers who became infected. The first B-cell vaccine (VaxGen's AIDSVax, a bivalent gp120-based subunit vaccine) tested in clinical trials also failed to protect volunteers from HIV infection, possibly due to its inability to elicit broad neutralizing antibody responses because of great variability and high glycosylation of gp120. Since the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) transmembrane subunit gp41 has relatively conserved sequence and less glycosylation sites than gp120, it may be a better target than gp120 for vaccine development. Indeed, two human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting gp41, 2F5 and 4E10, exhibit much broader neutralizing activity than those targeting gp120 (mAbs 2G12 and b12).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">HIV-1 gp41 (SEQ ID NO. 2) plays an essential role in virus fusion with the target cell. HIV-1 pg41 consists of three essential functional regions: fusion peptide (FP), N-terminal heptad repeat (called NHR or HR1, which refer to the same sequence and are considered equivalent as used herein) and C-terminal heptad repeat (called CHR or HR2, which refer to the same sequence and are considered equivalent as used herein) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). Both NHR and CHR contain a number of leucine zipper-like motifs which have tendency to form coiled coil structures. Peptides derived from the NHR and CHR regions are effective in inhibiting HIV-1 fusion with the target cells and one of the CHR-peptides, enfuvirtide was licensed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2003 as the first member of a new class of anti-HIV drugs-HIV fusion inhibitors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">HIV fusion with the host cell is initiated by binding of Env surface subunit 120 to the primary receptor CD4 and a co-receptor, CXCR4 or CCR5, resulting in a series of conformational changes in gp41, including insertion of FP into the target cell membrane and association of CHR-helices with the NHR-trimer, a prehairpin intermediate, to form a stable six-helix bundle (6-HB) core, which bring the viral envelope and target cell membrane into close proximity for fusion. X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that 6-HB consists of three molecules of a NHR-peptide that form the inner trimeric coiled-coil and three copies of a CHR-peptide that pack obliquely in an anti-parallel configuration into the highly conserved hydrophobic grooves on the surface of the internal NHR-trimer. Each groove has a deep hydrophobic pocket (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, circled at bottom), which plays an important role in viral fusion and maintaining the stability of the 6-HB. Accordingly, it is proposed that a CHR-peptide (e.g., enfuvirtide or C34) inhibits HIV-1 fusion by binding to the viral gp41 NHR-trimer at the fusion-intermediate state to block the formation of fusion-active core of gp41. Therefore, the gp41 NHR-trimer is a crucial target for HIV therapeutics, and may also serve as an important target for HIV vaccines.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the gp41 NHR-peptides cannot form stable and soluble trimers in vitro spontaneously because these peptides have tendency to aggregate in physiological solutions. To study the structure, function and immunogenicity of the gp41 prehairpin intermediate, several soluble and stable NHR-trimer mimetics have been created, including IQN17 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>), in which a 17-mer NHR-peptide (aa 565-581) involving in formation of the gp41 hydrophobic pocket is linked with GCN4-pI<sub>Q</sub>I (IQ) motif, a soluble trimeric coiled coil, and similar mimetics with higher stability, including IZN17, IZN36 and (ccIZN17)<sub>3</sub>, in which IQ is replaced with more stable trimerization motif, IZ. Other examples of NHR-trimer mimetics include NCCG-gp41, N35<sub>CCG</sub>-N13, and 5-Helix in which one CHR peptide of the 6-HB is missing so as to expose the groove of the NHR-trimer. Although all these NHR-trimer mimetics properly present the hydrophobic groove and pocket and are effective in interacting with viral gp41 CHR to inhibit HIV-1 fusion, none of them could induce detectable neutralizing antibody responses in immunized animals. It is believed that the accessibility of the prehairpin intermediate of gp41 to antibody molecules (e.g., IgG) is limited because antisera directed against NHR-peptides exhibited no neutralizing activity at 37&#xb0; C., but were effective under suboptimal temperature (31.5&#xb0; C.) to prolong fusion intermediates. But interestingly, IgG1 m44, a human mAb directed against gp41 is much more potent than Fab m44 in neutralizing infection by primary HIV-1 isolates. Another human mAb, D5, that specifically binds to the pocket of NHR-trimer is highly potent to neutralize HIV-1 infection. Although rabbit antisera induced against N35<sub>CCG</sub>-N13 showed no neutralizing activity, purified IgG from the antisera (about 5-10% of total IgGs) with high-binding affinity to the NHR-trimer could significantly inhibit HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion. These data suggest that the gp41 NHR-trimer in the prehairpin fusion intermediate state is accessible to antibodies, which is not restricted by either antibody size or the presence of a kinetic barrier, but may be limited by the affinity of antibodies to bind with the NHR-trimer. Therefore, it is essential to design an immunogen with proper conformation and increased immunogenicity that can induce antibodies with high-binding affinity to the gp41 prehairpin intermediate.</p>

Disclosed herein is a subunit immunogenic composition comprising a fusion protein comprising at least a portion of the HIV-1 gp41, a trimerization motif and an immunoenhancer. The immunogenic compositions disclosed herein may be administered in any formulations and with any adjuvant.</p>

The N46 peptide and the recombinant protein without Fc, N46Fd (SEQ ID NO. 24) were used as controls. Unlike the N46 peptide and N46Fd, N46FdhFc elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses in the immunized mice against infection by laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 strains.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another embodiment, a fusion protein is provided comprising a gp41 NHR sequence derived from one of the following sequences: HIV-1 94UG103, subtype A (SEQ ID NO. 4); 92US657, subtype B (SEQ ID NO. 5); HIV-1 93IN101, subtype C (SEQ ID NO. 6); HIV-1 92UG001, subtype D (SEQ ID NO. 7); HIV-1 92THA009, subtype NE (SEQ ID NO. 8); HIV-1 93BR020, subtype F (SEQ ID NO. 9); HIV-1 RU570, subtype G (SEQ ID NO. 10); HIV-1 BCF02, group O (SEQ ID NO. 11); or from HIV-2 CBL20 (SEQ ID NO. 12), a trimerization motif and an immunoenhancer.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The fusion protein described herein comprises at least one gp41 NHR sequence derived from the entire NHR(HR1) region or from part of the NHR(HR1) region, e.g., N17 (SEQ ID NO. 13), N36 (SEQ ID NO. 14), N28 (SEQ ID NO. 15), N36 (SEQ ID NO. 16), N51 (SEQ ID NO. 17), or N63 (SEQ ID NO. 18) derived from HIV-1 HXB2 (subtype B).</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the fusion protein described herein comprises an entire gp41 sequence from HIV-1 HXB2 (SEQ ID NO. 2). In another embodiment, the fusion protein comprises an entire gp41 sequence from HIV-1, HIV-2 or SIV.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Moreover, fusion proteins disclosed herein comprise a trimerization or oligomerization motif that includes, but is not limited to, foldon (SEQ ID NO. 18), IQ (the IQ calmodulin-binding motif, SEQ ID NO. 19), and IZ (isoleucine zipper motif, SEQ ID NO. 20), Foldon is a trimerization or oligomerization motif from the T4 bacteriophage fibritin.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the immunoenhancer is immunoglobulin Fc fragment. The immunoglobulin molecule consists of two light chains and two heavy chains held together by disulfide bonds such that the chains form a Y shape. The base of the Y (carboxy terminus of the heavy chain) plays a role in modulating immune cell activity. This region is called the Fc (fragment, crystallizable) region, and is composed of two heavy chains that contribute two or three constant domains depending on the class of the antibody. By binding to specific proteins, the Fc region ensures that each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for a given antigen. The Fc region also binds to various cell receptors, such as Fc receptors, and other immune molecules, such as complement proteins. By doing this, it mediates different physiological effects including opsonization, cell lysis, and degranulation of mast cells, basophils and eosinophils.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As used herein, nucleotide sequences which are substantially the same share at least about 90% identity, and amino acid sequences which are substantially the same typically share more than 95% amino acid identity. It is recognized, however, that proteins (and DNA or mRNA encoding such proteins) containing less than the above-described level of homology arising as splice variants or that are modified by conservative amino acid substitutions (or substitution of degenerate codons) are contemplated to be within the scope of the present disclosure. As readily recognized by those of skill in the art, various ways have been devised to align sequences for comparison, e.g., Blosum 62 scoring matrix, as described by Henikoff and Henikoff in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915 (1992). Algorithms conveniently employed for this purpose are widely available (see, for example, Needleman and Wunsch in J. Mol. Bio. 48:443 (1970).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Therefore, disclosed herein are amino acid sequences 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to SEQ ID NOs:1-32.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Also disclosed herein are conservative amino acid substitutions of amino acids sequences SEQ ID NOs:1-32. Conservative amino acids substitutions are defined as changed, which although they alter the primary sequence of the protein or peptide, do not normally alter its function. Conservative amino acid substitutions typically include substitutions within the following groups: glycine and alanine; valine, isoleucine, and leucine; aspartic acid and glutamic acid; asparagine and glutamine; serine and threonine; lysine and arginine; and phenylalanine and tyrosine.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, the claimed fusion proteins can be constructed using overlapping primers. In another embodiment, the DNA sequence (GGCTATATTCCG GAAGCGCCGCGTGATGGCCAGGCGTATGTGCGTAAAGATGGCGAATGGGTGCTG CTGTCTACCTTTCTG; SEQ ID NO:36) encoding Fd (aa sequence: GYIPEAPRDG QAYVRKDGEWVLLSTFL) is synthesized first. Separate PCR products of the gp41 sequence and Fd are generated and the gp41 segment-Fd fusion fragment is amplified by one-round PCR using a gp41 forward primer and Fd reverse primer with gp41 (or a fragment thereof) and Fd DNA (PCR products) as templates. The amplified gp41 segment-Fd PCR product is then inserted into the hFc vector, to get an gp41-Fd-hFc recombinant plasmid encoding gp41-Fd-hFc fusion proteins. For the purposes of this discussion, the term &#x201c;gp41&#x201d; or &#x201c;gp41 component&#x201d; refers to the full-length gp41 protein, or a fragment thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The gp41 component (gp41), trimerization or oligomerization motif component (TM) and the immunoenhancer component (1E) of the fusion proteins can be constructed in a variety of orientations including, but not limited to, gp41-TM-IE, gp41-IE-TM, IE-gp41-TM, TM-gp41-IE, etc. In one embodiment, the components are arranged gp41-TM-IE.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc (human Fc, hFc), pFUSE-mIgG2a-Fc2 (murine Fc, mFc), or pFUSE-rIgG2-Fc2 (rabbit Fc, rFc) vectors are used for construction of the disclosed fusion proteins. In another embodiment, the fusion proteins can be expressed from other mammalian cell expression vectors, including, but not limited to, pcDNA3.1, pcDNA6-His, PEE13.1, PEE1.41, pCMV-NEO-BAM, pSV2, and pCMV1,2,3,4,5,6. In another embodiment, the fusion proteins can be expressed from insect cell expression vectors including, but not limited to, pAcGP67, pFastBac Dual, and pMT/V5-His-TOPO. In yet another embodiment, the fusion proteins can be expressed from <i>E. coli </i>expression vectors including, but not limited to, pET, pET-SUMO, and pGEX vectors with GST.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The following expression systems are suitable for use in expressing the disclosed fusion proteins: mammalian cell expression systems such as, but not limited to, pcDNA expression system, and GS Gene expression system; insect cell expression systems such as, but not limited to, Bac-to-Bac expression system, baculovirus expression system and DES expression systems; and <i>E. coli </i>expression systems including, but not limited to, pET, pSUMO and GST expression systems.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Advantages of proteins expressed in mammalian cell expression systems include the follows. The mammalian cell expression system is a relatively mature eukaryotic system for expression of recombinant proteins. There is a far higher chance to get correctly folded soluble proteins with proper glycosylation, making the expressed protein maintain native conformation and keep sufficient bioactivity if necessary. This system can either transient or stable express recombinant antigens, and promote signal synthesis. Recombinant proteins expressed in this way may keep good antigenicity and immunogenicity. However, both insect and bacterial expression systems provide inexpensive and efficient expression of active proteins, particularly when glycosylation is not required for bioactivity.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The purification systems are dependent on whether a tag is linked or fused with the fusion proteins. When the fusion proteins are fused with IgG Fc vectors, Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography is used for the purification. If the fusion proteins are fused with GST proteins, the GST columns will be used for the purification. If the fusion proteins link with 6&#xd7;His tag at the N- or C-terminal, the expressed proteins are be purified using His tag columns. If no tag is linked with recombinant proteins, the expressed proteins re be purified using Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or other chromatographies.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In certain embodiments, the immunogenic compositions further comprise an adjuvant. Adjuvants suitable for use in animals include, but are not limited to, Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvants, Sigma Adjuvant System (SAS), and Ribi adjuvants. Adjuvants suitable for use in humans include, but are not limited to, MF59 (an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant), aluminum hydroxide, -phosphate or -oxide, HAVLOGEN&#xae; (an acrylic acid polymer-based adjuvant, Intervet Inc., Millsboro, Del.), polyacrylic acids, oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion based on, for example a mineral oil, such as BAYOL&#x2122; or MARCOL&#x2122; (Esso Imperial Oil Limited, Canada), or a vegetable oil such as vitamin E acetate, saponins, and Onchocerca volvulus activation-associated protein-1 (ASP-1) (see US 20060039921, which is incorporated by reference herein for all it discloses regarding ASP-1 adjuvants). However, components with adjuvant activity are widely known and, generally, any adjuvant may be utilized that does not adversely interfere with the efficacy or safety of the vaccine and/or immunogenic composition.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Vaccine and immunogenic compositions according to the various embodiments disclosed herein can be prepared and/or marketed in the form of a liquid, frozen suspension or in a lyophilized form. Typically, vaccines and/or immunogenic compositions prepared according to the present disclosure contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent customarily used for such compositions. Carriers include, but are not limited to, stabilizers, preservatives and buffers. Suitable stabilizers are, for example SPGA, Tween compositions (such as are available from A.G. Scientific, Inc., San Diego, Calif.), carbohydrates (such as sorbitol, mannitol, starch, sucrose, dextran, glutamate or glucose), proteins (such as dried milk serum, albumin or casein) or degradation products thereof. Non-limiting examples of suitable buffers include alkali metal phosphates. Suitable preservatives are thimerosal, merthiolate and gentamicin. Diluents include water, aqueous buffer (such as buffered saline), alcohols and polyols (such as glycerol).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Also disclosed herein are methods for inducing an immune response to HIV using the disclosed fusion proteins. Generally, the vaccine or immunogenic composition may be administered subcutaneously, intradermally, submucosally, or intramuscularly in an effective amount to prevent infection from HIV and/or treat an infection with HIV. An effective amount is defined as an amount of immunizing fusion protein that will induce immunity in the vaccinated animals, against challenge by a virulent virus. Immunity is defined herein as the induction of a significant higher level of protection in a population of the animal after vaccination compared to an unvaccinated group.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, in various formulations of the vaccines and/or immunogenic compositions, suitable excipients, stabilizers and the like may be added.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the HIV-1 HXB2 gp41 consists of an ectodomain, a transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic (CP) domains. The ectodomain contains: fusion peptide (FP); N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR), which has a pocket-forming sequence (underlined); Immunodominant (ID) loop; C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR), which contains a pocket-binding sequence (underlined); and a membrane proximal external region (MPER). The residue numbers of each region correspond to their positions in gp160 of HIV-1 HXB2. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B-E</figref> show the gp41 NHR-trimeric structures: B) IQN17 and (ccIZN17)<sub>3</sub>, which consists of a 17-mer pocket-forming sequence and a trimerization motif, GCN4-pIQI (IQ) or IZ; C) N46, a NHR-peptide (residues 536-581) containing the N17 pocket-forming sequence; D) N46Fd, a recombinant protein consisting of N46 and foldon (Fd), a trimerization motif; and E) N46FdhFc, a recombinant protein containing N46Fd and human IgG Fc. The conserved hydrophobic pocket is circled.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Construction of Plasmids Encoding N46Fd and N46FdhFc</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The N46 sequence was derived from the NHR region of HIV-1HXB2 gp41. The pHXB2-env plasmid was employed as a template to synthesize a DNA fragment encoding the N46 amino acid sequence. All primers and the DNA fragment encoding the Fd sequence were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa). The N46 DNA fragment was then linked with Fd DNA fragment using an overlapping primer design program. The N46Fd DNA fragment was applied as the template for PCR amplification using the forward primer 5&#x2032;-CCGGAATTCGACGCTGACGGTACAGG-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO:33) and the reverse primer 5&#x2032;-GGAAGATCTTCAGTGGTGGTGGTG GTGGTGCAGAAAGGTAGA-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO:34). The amplified N46Fd DNA fragment was digested by EcoRI and BgIII and inserted into the vector pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2, designated pFUSE-N46Fd and encoded the N46Fd fusion protein. Subsequently, the pFUSE-N46FdFc plasmid DNA encoding the N46FdhFc protein was constructed using the same method of preparation for pFUSE-N46Fd with the following exceptions: (i) the pFUSE-N46Fd instead of the pHXB2-N46Fd plasmid was used as the template, and (ii) the following reverse primer was used: 5&#x2032;-GGAAGATCTCAGAAAGGTAGACAG-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO:35; containing no stop codon). The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the maps of the plasmids encoding N46Fd (A) and N46FdhFc (B). &#x201c;6H&#x201d; and &#x201c;TGA*&#x201d; represent 6-His tag and stop codon, respectively.</p>

<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Expression of N46Fd and N46FdhFc in Mammalian Cells and <i>E. Coli </i></heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The plasmids of pFUSE-N46Fd and pFUSE-N46FdhFc were transformed into DH5&#x3b1; cells. A single colony from freshly streaked selective plate containing 25 &#x3bc;g/ml Zeocin was picked and inoculated in a starter culture of 5 ml LB medium containing 25 &#x3bc;g/ml Zeocin with shaking at 250 rpm for 8 hrs at 37&#xb0; C. Then 2 ml of the starter culture supernatants was applied to 400 ml LB containing 25 &#x3bc;g/ml Zeocin. After incubation overnight at 37&#xb0; C., the broth was centrifuged at 6,000 rpm (4,500&#xd7;g) for 15 min. The plasmid was purified using a Plasmid Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, Calif.) and then transfected to 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fresh DMEM was supplied next day. N46Fd and N46FdhFc were purified as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For expression of N46FdhFc in <i>E. coli</i>, the plasmids pGEX-N46Fd and pGEX-N46FdFc were transformed into Rosetta 2 (DE3) LysS complete cells, respectively, which were incubated in LB medium containing 100 &#x3bc;g/ml ampicillin at 37&#xb0; C. overnight. One colony was selected and transferred to 5 ml of LB medium. After incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 16 hrs, 2 ml culture supernatants were collected and transferred to 400 ml LB containing 100 &#x3bc;g/ml ampicillin and 0.5 mM IPTG to induce protein expression. After culture for 4 hrs, the pellets were collected after centrifugation at 6,000 rpm (4,500&#xd7;g) for 20 min, and then sonicated three times (10 min each time). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (20,000&#xd7;g) for 30 min and filtration with 0.45 &#x3bc;m membrane, the supernatants were passed through a GST-binding column and the GST-tag was removed by treatment with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare, N.J.). N46Fd was purified by using a Ni-NTA His-Bind Superflow column since the foldon fragment in N46Fd can bind with his-binding beads. N46FdhFc was further purified by loading the eluated fractions to Protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column (Amerhsam Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). After washing, N46FdhFc was eluted with glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.7) and neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9), which was replaced by PBS using 10 kd filter (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, Mass.) through centrifugation at 2,900 rpm (2,003&#xd7;g) for 3 times and 20 min for each time. The purified protein was stored at &#x2212;4&#xb0; C. until use.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The recombinant fusion proteins N46Fd and N46FdhFc as well as the synthetic peptide N46 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, acid native PAGE, and Western blot. Purified N46, N46Fd and N46FdhFc (boiled and unboiled) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10-20% Tris-Tricine Gradient Gels (Invitrogen). The peptide or proteins were also analyzed by acid native PAGE as described by Sackett et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 281(31):21755-62, 2006). Briefly, 10% polyacrylamide continuous native gels at pH 3.4 were prepared using 30 mM &#x3b2;-alanine and 42 mM formic acid and pre-run in the same buffer containing 100 &#x3bc;M TCEP as a reducing agent. Gel electrophoresis was performed with a constant voltage of 125 V at room temperature for 2 h. The gel was then stained with Coomassie blue and imaged with a Fluor Chem 8800 imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, Calif.). For western-blotting, the peptide or proteins within the gels after separation by SDS-PAGE or acid native PAGE were transferred onto a 0.45 &#x3bc;m-pore nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) at 100 V for 2 h and then 60 V for 1 h. The blotted membranes were rinsed with PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) three times for 5 min and then blocked in fresh PBST containing 5% non-fat dried milk at 4&#xb0; C. overnight. After several washes, the membranes were incubated in rabbit anti-N46 IgG (1 &#x3bc;g/ml). HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (for anti-N46) and the ECL substrate solution (Amersham) were added sequentially. The blots were then visualized with autoradiography films.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, without boiling, N46Fd was found in trimeric and monomeric forms, while N46FdhFc was found mainly in trimeric form under reducing condition because the Fd-stabilized trimer is resistant to reducing reagent. With boiling, N46Fd and N46FdhFc were mainly in monomeric and dimeric forms, respectively. N46 was in monomeric form under reducing condition with or without boiling. All the major bands reacted with polyclonal anti-N46 antibodies by Western blots (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). N46, N46Fd and N46FdhFc displayed no bands in native PAGE because they contain a net positive charge, while each of them showed a single band in acid native PAGE (stained with Coomassie blue) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). All three immunogens reacted with rabbit anti-N46 antibodies by Western blots (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). These results suggest that N46Fd and N46FdhFc are in trimeric or other oligomeric forms.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Balb/c mice were immunized with adjuvant and N46, N46Fd or N46FdhFc and individual mouse serum was collected seven days after the last boost and tested for neutralizing activity against HIV-1 IIIB infection by the XTT assay for measuring HIV-1-mediated CPE. The XTT assay was conducted as previously described in Jiang et al. (J. Exp. Med. 174, 1557-1563, 1991). Briefly, MT-2 cells were infected with HIV-1 IIIB strain at 100 TCID<sub>50 </sub>(50% tissue culture infective dose) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS in the presence or absence of an antibody or antiserum at a series of 2-fold dilution at 37&#xb0; C. overnight. The culture supernatants were then removed and fresh media were added. On day 6 post-infection, 50 &#x3bc;l of XTT solution (1 mg/ml) containing 0.02 &#x3bc;M of phenazine methosulphate (PMS) was added. After 4 hrs, absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured with an ELISA reader and the ND50 values were calculated as described above. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and Table 3, sera from mice immunized with N46 and N46Fd exhibited no detectable inhibitory activity, while sera from all the five mice vaccinated with N46FdhFc exhibited potent neutralizing activity.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">These antisera were further tested for their neutralizing activity against infection by HIV-1 Bal (subtype B, R5) and an enfuvirtide-resistant HIV-1 strain NL4-3V38A/N42T in CEMx174 5.25M7 cells using luciferase assay by using a luciferase assay. Briefly, 50 &#x3bc;l of an antibody or antiserum from immunized mice at a series of dilution was incubated with an equal volume of an HIV-1 isolate at 0.01 multiplicity of infection (MOI) at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 min, followed by addition of the mixture to 100 &#x3bc;l CEMx174 5.25M7 or TZM-bI cells (1&#xd7;10<sup>5</sup>/ml) that were pre-cultured in a 96-well plate at 37&#xb0; C. overnight. After further culture at 37&#xb0; C. for 3 days, the cells were harvested and lysed with 50 &#x3bc;l lysing reagent. The luciferase activity was analyzed using a luciferase kit (Promega Corp.) and a luminometer (Model: Ultra 386, Tecan) according to the manufacture's instruction. The ND50 value of an antiserum was calculated using the software CalcuSyn. Similarly, anti-N46FdhFc antisera exhibited potent neutralizing activity against these two HIV-1 strains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and Table 3).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The neutralizing activity of antibodies or antisera against primary HIV-1 isolates was determined as previously described in Jiang et al. (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 48, 4349-4359, 2004). Briefly, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the blood of healthy donors using a standard density gradient (Histopaque-1077, Sigma) centrifugation. After incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 2 h, the nonadherent cells were collected and resuspended at 5&#xd7;10<sup>5</sup>/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 5 &#x3bc;g of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)/ml, and 100 U of IL-2/ml, followed by incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 3 days. The PHA-stimulated cells were infected with the corresponding primary HIV-1 isolates at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in the absence or presence of an antibody at a series of dilutions. The supernatants were collected 7 days post infection and mixed with equal volumes of 5% Triton X-100 for the detection of the p24 protein using ELISA as described in Jiang et al. with modification. Briefly, the wells of polystyrene plates (Immulon 1B, Dynex Technology, Chantilly, Va.) were coated with mouse anti-p24 mAb 183-12H-5C (NIH ARRRP) at 5 &#x3bc;g/ml in 0.05 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4&#xb0; C. overnight, followed by washes with PBS-T buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20) and blocking with PBS containing 2% dry fat-free milk (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, Calif.). Triton X-100 virus lysates were then added and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 1 h. After extensive washes, human anti-p24 mAb (37G12, purchased from Polymun, Vienna, Austria), biotin labeled anti-human IgG1 (Santa Cruz Biotech., Santa Cruz, Calif.), SA-HRP and TMB were added sequentially. Reactions were terminated by addition of 1N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Absorbance at 450 nm was recorded in an ELISA reader (Ultra 384, Tecan). Recombinant protein p24 (US Biological, Swampscott, Mass.) was used for establishing a standard dose response curve. These antisera against N46FdhFc also significantly neutralized infection of PBMCs by primary HIV-1 isolates 94UG103 (A, X4R5) and 92US657 (B, R5). However, the antisera directed against N46 and N46Fd at 1:40 dilution had no significant neutralizing activity against any of the viruses tested (Table 3). These results suggest that N46FdhFc is able to elicit antibodies with broad neutralizing activities.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The HIV gp41 fusion intermediate (NHR-trimer) plays a critical role in the HIV-1 fusion process. Therefore, the antibodies induced against the gp41 NHR-trimer may have inhibitory activities on HIV-induced cell-cell fusion. The inhibitory activities of the antibodies or antisera on HIV-induced cell-cell fusion were determined using a dye transfer assay as described by Jiang et al. (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 48, 4349-4359, 2004). Briefly, H9/HIV-1<sub>IIIB </sub>cells were pre-labeled with a fluorescent dye, Calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and incubated with a testing antibody or antiserum at a series of dilution at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 min in a 96-well cell culture plate. Then the CD4+MT-2 cells were added to the H9/HIV-1IIIB cells at a ratio of 10:1, followed by incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 2 hrs. The fused and unfused calcein-labeled HIV-1-infected cells were counted under an inverted fluorescence microscope with an eyepiece micrometer disc. The percent inhibition of cell fusion by an antibody or antiserum and the EC50 values were calculated using the software CalcuSyn. Antisera from all the five mice immunized with N46FdhFc exhibited potent HIV-1 fusion inhibitory activity with average 1050 of 1:154 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), while the antisera from mice immunized with N46 and N46Fd exhibited no detectable inhibitory activity at 1:40.</p>
<heading id="h-0021" level="1">Example 7</heading>
<heading id="h-0022" level="1">Antibodies Induced by N46FdhFc Bound Preferably to the gp41 Pocket Region</heading>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">To determine the target site of the neutralizing antibodies elicited by the N46FdhFc, antibody titers in the anti-N46, anti-N46Fd and anti-N46FdhFc antisera was compared against a series of antigens, including N46, Fd, IQN17, and (ccIZN17)<sub>3</sub>. For assessing the titers of antibodies in mouse sera against the gp41 NHR-trimer, the wells of a 96-well polystyrene plate (Costar) were coated with N46, Fd, or NHR-trimer, e.g., IQN17, or (ccIZN17)<sub>3</sub>, at 10 &#x3bc;g/ml in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.8) at 4&#xb0; C. overnight, and blocked with 2% non-fat milk in PBS for 3 hrs at 37&#xb0; C. Mouse sera in a series of 2-fold dilution were added. The plate was washed with the washing buffer (PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20) for 6 times to remove any unbound antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) linked goat-anti-mouse IgG was added, followed by incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 min. The reaction was visualized by addition of the substrate 3,3&#x2032;,5,5&#x2032;-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and A450 was measured by using an ELISA reader (Tecan US).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in Table 4, anti-N46 sera exhibited much higher binding titers against the N46 peptide and lower antibody titers against IQN17 and (ccIZN17)<sub>3 </sub>than those directed against N46Fd and N46FdhFc. This suggests that anti-N46 antibodies mainly bind to linear epitopes in the NHR domain, while the antibodies to N46Fd and N46FdhFc preferably react with conformational epitopes in the NHR-trimers. Notably, antisera directed against N46FdhFc bound to IQN17 and (ccIZN17)<sub>3 </sub>much more strongly than the anti-N46Fd antisera. This indicates that N46FdhFc elicits high levels of antibodies that may bind specifically to the pocket-forming sequence (N17), which overlaps the C-terminal fragment of N46 in the immunogen (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and that the neutralizing epitope(s) may be located in the pocket region. High titers of anti-Fd and anti-human IgG Fc antibodies were detected in the mouse antisera against N46FdhFc. However, the antisera from the mice immunized only with Fd or human IgG Fc had no virus neutralizing activity (data not shown), suggesting that the anti-Fd and anti-Fc antibodies in the anti-N46FdhFc sera are not responsible for the HIV-1 neutralization activity. Interestingly, the titer of antibodies to Fd in the anti-N46Fd sera (1:320,000) was much higher than that in the anti-N46FdhFc sera (1:12,126) (Table 4). This suggests that, although Fd in the fusion protein is highly immunogenic, the addition of the human IgG Fc to the C-terminus of N46Fd (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) might suppress the immunogenicity of Fd. This may be one of the reasons why N46FdhFc, but not N46Fd, elicits neutralizing antibody responses. Apparently, fusion of the Fc domain of human IgG to the C-terminus of N46Fd is critical for the design of N46FdhFc as an immunogen. Firstly, the Fc domain in N46FdhFc may suppress the immunogenicity of Fd, perhaps by covering Fd (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>) to prevent contact of Fd with antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and thus resulting in reduction of the immune interference of Fd with the immunogenicity of NHR-trimer. Secondly, the Fc domain in an immunogen may have an immunoenhancing effect because Fc-tagged protein can bind the Fc receptor (FcR) on dendritic cells or other APCs and thus promote internalization of the immunogen and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted antigen presentation. Thirdly, conjugation of a protein with Fc may prolong the half-life of the immunogen in immunized animals and thus enhance its immunogenicity.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">To investigate the mechanism by which anti-N46FdhFc antibodies neutralize HIV-1 infection and block HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion, the inhibitory activities of antibodies in the mouse anti-N46, anti-N46Fd and anti-N46FdhFc antisera were compared with normal mouse IgG as control. The inhibitory activity of antibodies on the 6-HB core formation between N46 (SEQ ID NO. 3) and biotinylated C34 (C34-biotin) was determined by an ELISA with a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) NC-1 (Jiang et al. J. Virol. 72, 10213-10217, 1998) and as previously described (He et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 105, 16332-16337, 2008). Briefly, an antibody at a series of dilutions was pre-incubated with equal amount of N46 at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 min, followed by addition of C34-biotin (0.5 &#x3bc;M). The mixture was added to the wells of a microplate coated with mAb NC-1 IgG (2 &#x3bc;g/ml in 0.1M Tris, pH 8.8) and blocked with 2% non-fat milk in PBS. The plate was then incubated for 30 min and washed with the washing buffer for 6 times to remove any unbound peptide. SA-HRP and TMB were added sequentially and A450 was measured. The percent inhibition of 6-HB formation and the IC<sub>50 </sub>values were calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, anti-N46FdhFc IgG effectively blocked the 6-HB core formation between N46 and C34 as determined by ELISA. However, normal mouse IgG and antibodies specific for N46 and N46Fd had no significant effect on the inhibition of gp41 6-HB core formation. These results suggest that N46FdhFc elicits antibodies that bind preferably to the viral gp41 pocket region and thus block the fusion-active 6-HB core formation between the viral gp41 NHR and CHR, and consequently result in the inhibition of HIV-1 fusion with the target cell and viral entry.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term &#x201c;about.&#x201d; Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Harvesting the full richness of biodiversity is instantly recognized by Diversa Corporation as a powerful means to access both novel molecules having direct commercial utility as well as molecular templates that could be retooled to acquire commercial utility. A directed evolution process for rapid and facilitated production from a progenitor polynucleotide template, of a library of mutagenized progeny polynucleotides wherein each of the 20 naturally encoded amino acids is encoded at each original codon position. This method, termed site-saturation mutagenesis, or simply saturation mutagenesis, is preferably based on the use of the degenerate N,N,G/T sequence. Also, a method of non-stochastically producing a library of chimeric nucleic acid molecules having an overall assembly order that is chosen by design. Accordingly, a set of progenitor templates, such as genes (e.g. a family of esterase genes) or genes pathways (e.g. encoding antibiotics) can be shuffled to generate a sizable library of distinct progeny polynucleotide molecules (e.g. 10<sup>100</sup>) and correspondingly encoded polypeptides. Screening of these polynucleotide libraries enables the identification of a desirable molecular species that has a desirable property, such as a specific enzymatic activity serviceable for a commercial application, or a novel antibiotic. Also, a method of retooling genes and gene pathways by the introduction of regulatory sequences, such as promoters, that are operable in an intended host, thus conferring operability to a novel gene pathway when it is introduced into an intended host. For example a novel man-made gene pathway, generated based on microbially-derived progenitor templates, that is operable in a plant cell.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to the field of protein engineering. Specifically, this invention relates to a directed evolution method for preparing a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide. More specifically, this invention relates to a method of using mutagenesis to generate a novel polynucleotide encoding a novel polypeptide, which novel polypeptide is itself an improved biological molecule &#x26;/or contributes to the generation of another improved biological molecule. More specifically still, this invention relates to a method of performing both non-stochastic polynucleotide chimerization and non-stochastic site-directed point mutagenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thus, in one aspect, this invention relates to a method of generating a progeny set of chimeric polynucleotide(s) by means that are synthetic and non-stochastic, and where the design of the progeny polynucleotide(s) is derived by analysis of a parental set of polynucleotides &#x26;/or of the polypeptides correspondingly encoded by the parental polynucleotides.

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">General Overview of the Problem to Be Solved</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Brief Summary: It is instantly appreciated that harvesting the full potential of nature's diversity can include both the step of discovery and the step of optimizing what is discovered. For example, the step of discovery allows one to mine biological molecules that have commercial utility. It is instantly appreciated that the ability to harvest the full richness of biodiversity, i.e. to mine biological molecules from a wide range of environmental conditions, is critical to the ability to discover novel molecules adapted to <?delete-start id="REI-00003"  date="20150120" ?>funtion<?delete-end id="REI-00003" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00004"  date="20150120" ?>function <?insert-end id="REI-00004" ?>under a wide variety of conditions, including extremes of conditions, such as may be found in a commercial application.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, it is also instantly appreciated that only <?delete-start id="REI-00005"  date="20150120" ?>occassionally<?delete-end id="REI-00005" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00006"  date="20150120" ?>occasionally <?insert-end id="REI-00006" ?>are there criteria for selection &#x26;/or survival in nature that point in the exact direction of particular commercial needs. Instead, it is often the case that a naturally occurring molecule will require a certain amount of change&#x2014;from fine tuning to sweeping modification&#x2014;in order to fulfill a particular unmet commercial need. Thus, to meet certain commercial needs (e.g., a need for a molecule that is functional under a specific set of commercial processing conditions) it is sometimes advantageous to experimentally modify a naturally <?delete-start id="REI-00007"  date="20150120" ?>expresed<?delete-end id="REI-00007" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00008"  date="20150120" ?>expressed <?insert-end id="REI-00008" ?>molecule to achieve properties beyond what natural evolution has provided &#x26;/or is likely to provide in the near future.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The approach, termed directed evolution, of experimentally modifying a biological molecule towards a desirable property, can be achieved by mutagenizing one or more parental molecular templates and by identifying any desirable molecules among the progeny molecules. Currently available technologies in directed evolution include methods for achieving stochastic (i.e. random) mutagenesis and methods for achieving non-stochastic (non-random) mutagenesis. However, critical shortfalls in both types of methods are identified in the instant disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In prelude, it is noteworthy that it may be argued philosophically by some that all mutagenesis&#x2014;if considered from an objective point of view&#x2014;is non-stochastic; and furthermore that the entire universe is undergoing a process that&#x2014;if considered from an objective point of view&#x2014;is non-stochastic. Whether this is true is outside of the scope of the instant consideration. Accordingly, as used herein, the terms &#x201c;randomness&#x201d;, &#x201c;uncertainty&#x201d;, and &#x201c;unpredictability&#x201d; have subjective meanings, and the knowledge, particularly the predictive knowledge, of the designer of an experimental process is a determinant of whether the process is stochastic or non-stochastic.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">By way of illustration, stochastic or random mutagenesis is exemplified by a situation in which a progenitor molecular template is mutated (modified or changed) to yield a set of progeny molecules having mutation(s) that are not predetermined. Thus, in an in vitro stochastic mutagenesis reaction, for example, there is not a particular predetermined product whose production is intended; rather there is an uncertainty&#x2014;hence randomness&#x2014;regarding the exact nature of the mutations achieved, and thus also regarding the products generated. In contrast, non-stochastic or non-random mutagenesis is exemplified by a situation in which a progenitor molecular template is mutated (modified or changed) to yield a progeny molecule having one or more predetermined mutations. It is appreciated that the presence of background products in some quantity is a reality in many reactions where molecular processing occurs, and the presence of these background products does not detract from the non-stochastic nature of a mutagenesis process having a predetermined product.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, as used herein, stochastic mutagenesis is manifested in processes such as error-prone PCR and stochastic shuffling, where the mutation(s) achieved are random or not predetermined. In contrast, as used herein, non-stochastic mutagenesis is manifested in the instantly disclosed processes such as gene site-saturation mutagenesis and synthetic ligation reassembly, where the exact chemical structure(s) of the intended product(s) are predetermined.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In brief, existing mutagenesis methods that are non-stochastic have been serviceable in generating from one to only a very small number of predetermined mutations per method application, and thus produce per method application from one to only a few progeny molecules that have predetermined molecular structures. Moreover, the types of mutations currently available by the application of these non-stochastic methods are also limited, and thus so are the types of progeny mutant molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In contrast, existing methods for mutagenesis that are stochastic in nature have been serviceable for generating somewhat larger numbers of mutations per method application&#x2014;though in a random fashion &#x26; usually with a large but unavoidable contingency of undesirable background products. Thus, these existing stochastic methods can produce per method application larger numbers of progeny molecules, but that have undetermined molecular structures. The types of mutations that can be achieved by application of these current stochastic methods are also limited, and thus so are the types of progeny mutant molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is instantly appreciated that there is a need for the development of non-stochastic mutagenesis methods that:

        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0017">2) Can be used to readily generate more types of mutations;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0018">3) Can produce a correspondingly larger variety of progeny mutant molecules;</li>

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0022">The instant invention satisfies all of these needs.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0023">Directed Evolution Supplements Natural Evolution: Natural evolution has been a springboard for directed or experimental evolution, serving both as a reservoir of methods to be mimicked and of molecular templates to be mutagenized. It is appreciated that, despite its intrinsic process-related limitations (in the types of favored &#x26;/or allowed mutagenesis processes) and in its speed, natural evolution has had the advantage of having been in process for millions of years and throughout a wide diversity of environments. Accordingly, natural evolution (molecular mutagenesis and selection in nature) has resulted in the generation of a wealth of biological compounds that have shown usefulness in certain commercial applications.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0024">However, it is instantly appreciated that many unmet commercial needs are discordant with any evolutionary pressure &#x26;/or direction that can be found in nature. Moreover, it is often the case that when commercially useful mutations would otherwise be favored at the molecular level in nature, natural evolution often overrides the positive selection of such mutations, e.g. when there is a concurrent detriment to an organism as a whole (such as when a favorable mutation is accompanied by a detrimental mutation). Additionally, natural evolution is often slow, and favors fidelity in many types of replication. Additionally still, natural evolution often favors a path paved mainly by consecutive beneficial mutations while tending to avoid a plurality of successive negative mutations, even though such negative mutations may prove beneficial when combined, or may lead&#x2014;through a circuitous route&#x2014;to final state that is beneficial.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0025">Moreover, natural evolution advances through specific steps (e.g. specific mutagenesis and selection processes), with avoidance of less favored steps. For example, many nucleic acids do not reach close enough proximity to each other in a operative environment to undergo chimerization or incorporation or other types of transfers from one species to another. Thus, e.g., when sexual intercourse between 2 particular species is avoided in nature, the chimerization of nucleic acids from these 2 species is likewise unlikely, with parasites common to the two species serving as an example of a very slow passageway for inter-molecular encounters and exchanges of DNA. For another example, the generation of a molecule causing self-toxicity or self-lethality or sexual sterility is avoided in nature. For yet another example, the propagation of a molecule having no particular immediate benefit to an organism is prone to vanish in subsequent generations of the organism. Furthermore, e.g., there is no selection pressure for improving the performance of molecule under conditions other than those to which it is exposed in its endogenous environment; e.g. a cytoplasmic molecule is not likely to acquire functional features extending beyond what is required of it in the cytoplasm. Furthermore still, the propagation of a biological molecule is susceptible to any global detrimental effects&#x2014;whether caused by itself or not&#x2014;on its ecosystem. These and other characteristics greatly limit the types of mutations that can be propagated in nature.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0026">On the other hand, directed (or experimental) evolution&#x2014;particularly as provided herein&#x2014;can be performed much more rapidly and can be directed in a more streamlined manner at evolving a predetermined molecular property that is commercially desirable where nature does not provide one &#x26;/or is not likely to provide. Moreover, the directed evolution invention provided herein can provide more wide-ranging possibilities in the types of steps that can be used in mutagenesis and selection processes. Accordingly, using templates harvested from nature, the instant directed evolution invention provides more wide-ranging possibilities in the types of progeny molecules that can be generated and in the speed at which they can be generated than often nature itself might be expected to in the same length of time.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0027">In a particular exemplification, the instantly disclosed directed evolution methods can be applied iteratively to produce a lineage of progeny molecules (e.g. comprising successive sets of progeny molecules) that would not likely be propagated (i.e., generated &#x26;/or selected for) in nature, but that could lead to the generation of a desirable downstream mutagenesis product that is not achievable by natural evolution.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0028">Previous Directed Evolution Methods Are Suboptimal:</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0029">Mutagenesis has been attempted in the past on many occasions, but by methods that are inadequate for the purpose of this invention. For example, previously described non-stochastic methods have been serviceable in the generation of only very small sets of progeny molecules (comprised often of merely a solitary progeny molecule). By way of illustration, a chimeric gene has been made by joining 2 polynucleotide fragments using compatible sticky ends generated by restriction enzyme(s), where each fragment is derived from a separate progenitor (or parental) molecule. Another example might be the mutagenesis of a single codon position (i.e. to achieve a codon substitution, addition, or deletion) in a parental polynucleotide to generate a single progeny polynucleotide encoding for a single site-mutagenized polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0030">Previous non-stochastic approaches have only been serviceable in the generation of but one to a few mutations per method application. Thus, these previously described non-stochastic methods thus fail to address one of the central goals of this invention, namely the exhaustive and non-stochastic chimerization of nucleic acids. Accordingly previous non-stochastic methods leave untapped the vast majority of the possible point mutations, chimerizations, and combinations thereof, which may lead to the generation of highly desirable progeny molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0031">In contrast, stochastic methods have been used to achieve larger numbers of point mutations and/or chimerizations than non-stochastic methods; for this reason, stochastic methods have comprised the predominant approach for generating a set of progeny molecules that can be subjected to screening, and amongst which a desirable molecular species might hopefully be found. However, a major drawback of these approaches is that&#x2014;because of their stochastic nature&#x2014;there is a randomness to the exact components in each set of progeny molecules that is produced. Accordingly, the experimentalist typically has little or no idea what exact progeny molecular species are represented in a particular reaction vessel prior to their generation. Thus, when a stochastic procedure is repeated (e.g. in a continuation of a search for a desirable progeny molecule), the re-generation and re-screening of previously discarded undesirable molecular species becomes a labor-intensive obstruction to progress, causing a circuitous&#x2014;if not circular&#x2014;path to be taken. The drawbacks of such a highly suboptimal path can be addressed by subjecting a stochastically generated set of progeny molecules to a labor-incurring process, such as sequencing, in order to identify their molecular structures, but even this is an incomplete remedy.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0032">Moreover, current stochastic approaches are highly unsuitable for comprehensively or exhaustively generating all the molecular species within a particular grouping of mutations, for attributing functionality to specific structural groups in a template molecule (e.g. a specific single amino acid position or a sequence comprised of two or more amino acids positions), and for categorizing and comparing specific grouping of mutations. Accordingly, current stochastic approaches do not inherently enable the systematic elimination of unwanted mutagenesis results, and are, in sum, burdened by too many inherently shortcomings to be optimal for directed evolution.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0033">In a non-limiting aspect, the instant invention addresses these problems by providing non-stochastic means for comprehensively and exhaustively generating all possible point mutations in a parental template. In another non-limiting aspect, the instant invention further provides means for exhaustively generating all possible chimerizations within a group of chimerizations. Thus, the aforementioned problems are solved by the instant invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0034">Specific shortfalls in the technological landscape addressed by this invention include:

    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0035">1) Site-directed mutagenesis technologies, such as sloppy or low-fidelity PCR, are ineffective for systematically achieving at each position (site) along a polypeptide sequence the full (saturated) range of possible mutations (i.e. all possible amino acid substitutions).</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0036">2) There is no relatively easy systematic means for rapidly analyzing the large amount of information that can be contained in a molecular sequence and in the potentially colossal number or progeny molecules that could be conceivably obtained by the directed evolution of one or more molecular templates.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0037">3) There is no relatively easy systematic means for providing comprehensive empirical information relating structure to function for molecular positions.</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0040">An exceedingly large number of possibilities exist for the purposeful and random combination of amino acids within a protein to produce useful hybrid proteins and their corresponding biological molecules encoding for these hybrid proteins, i.e., DNA, RNA. Accordingly, there is a need to produce and screen a wide variety of such hybrid proteins for a desirable utility, particularly widely varying random proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0041">The complexity of an active sequence of a biological macromolecule (e.g., polynucleotides, polypeptides, and molecules that are comprised of both polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences) has been called its information content (&#x201c;IC&#x201d;), which has been defined as the resistance of the active protein to amino acid sequence variation (calculated from the minimum number of invariable amino acids (bits) required to describe a family of related sequences with the same function). Proteins that are more sensitive to random mutagenesis have a high information content.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0042">Molecular biology developments, such as molecular libraries, have allowed the identification of quite a large number of variable bases, and even provide ways to select functional sequences from random libraries. In such libraries, most residues can be varied (although typically not all at the same time) depending on compensating changes in the context. Thus, while a 100 amino acid protein can contain only 2,000 different mutations, 20<sup>100 </sup>sequence combinations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0043">Information density is the IC per unit length of a sequence. Active sites of enzymes tend to have a high information density. By contrast, flexible linkers of information in enzymes have a low information density.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0044">Current methods in widespread use for creating alternative proteins in a library format are error-prone polymerase chain reactions and cassette mutagenesis, in which the specific region to be optimized is replaced with a synthetically mutagenized oligonucleotide. In both cases, a substantial number of mutant sites are generated around certain sites in the original sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0045">Error-prone PCR uses low-fidelity polymerization conditions to introduce a low level of point mutations randomly over a long sequence. In a mixture of fragments of unknown sequence, error-prone PCR can be used to mutagenize the mixture. The published error-prone PCR protocols suffer from a low processivity of the polymerase. Therefore, the protocol is unable to result in the random mutagenesis of an average-sized gene. This inability limits the practical application of error-prone PCR. Some computer simulations have suggested that point mutagenesis alone may often be too gradual to allow the large-scale block changes that are required for continued and dramatic sequence evolution. Further, the published error-prone PCR protocols do not allow for amplification of DNA fragments greater than 0.5 to 1.0 kb, limiting their practical application. In addition, repeated cycles of error-prone PCR can lead to an accumulation of neutral mutations with undesired results, such as affecting a protein's immunogenicity but not its binding affinity.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0046">In oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, a short sequence is replaced with a synthetically mutagenized oligonucleotide. This approach does not generate combinations of distant mutations and is thus not combinatorial. The limited library size relative to the vast sequence length means that many rounds of selection are unavoidable for protein optimization. Mutagenesis with synthetic oligonucleotides requires sequencing of individual clones after each selection round followed by grouping them into families, arbitrarily choosing a single family, and reducing it to a consensus motif. Such motif is re-synthesized and reinserted into a single gene followed by additional selection. This step process constitutes a statistical bottleneck, is labor intensive, and is not practical for many rounds of mutagenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0047">Error-prone PCR and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis are thus useful for single cycles of sequence fine tuning, but rapidly become too limiting when they are applied for multiple cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0048">Another limitation of error-prone PCR is that the rate of down-mutations grows with the information content of the sequence. As the information content, library size, and mutagenesis rate increase, the balance of down-mutations to up-mutations will statistically prevent the selection of further improvements (statistical ceiling).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0049">In cassette mutagenesis, a sequence block of a single template is typically replaced by a (partially) randomized sequence. Therefore, the maximum information content that can be obtained is statistically limited by the number of random sequences (i.e., library size). This eliminates other sequence families which are not currently best, but which may have greater long term potential.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0050">Also, mutagenesis with synthetic oligonucleotides requires sequencing of individual clones after each selection round. Thus, such an approach is tedious and impractical for many rounds of mutagenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0051">Thus, error-prone PCR and cassette mutagenesis are best suited, and have been widely used, for fine-tuning areas of comparatively low information content. One apparent exception is the selection of an RNA ligase ribozyme from a random library using many rounds of amplification by error-prone PCR and selection.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0052">In nature, the evolution of most organisms occurs by natural selection and sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction ensures mixing and combining of the genes in the offspring of the selected individuals. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes from the parents line up with one another and cross-over part way along their length, thus randomly swapping genetic material. Such swapping or shuffling of the DNA allows organisms to evolve more rapidly.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0053">In recombination, because the inserted sequences were of proven utility in a homologous environment, the inserted sequences are likely to still have substantial information content once they are inserted into the new sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0054">Theoretically there are 2,000 different single mutants of a 100 amino acid protein. However, a protein of 100 amino acids has 20<sup>100 </sup>possible sequence combinations, a number which is too large to exhaustively explore by conventional methods. It would be advantageous to develop a system which would allow generation and screening of all of these possible combination mutations.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0055">Some workers in the art have utilized an in vivo site specific recombination system to generate hybrids of combine light chain antibody genes with heavy chain antibody genes for expression in a phage system. However, their system relies on specific sites of recombination and is limited accordingly. Simultaneous mutagenesis of antibody CDR regions in single chain antibodies (scFv) by overlapping extension and PCR have been reported.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0056">Others have described a method for generating a large population of multiple hybrids using random in vivo recombination. This method requires the recombination of two different libraries of plasmids, each library having a different selectable marker. The method is limited to a finite number of recombinations equal to the number of selectable markers existing, and produces a concomitant linear increase in the number of marker genes linked to the selected sequence(s).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0057">In vivo recombination between two homologous, but truncated, insect-toxin genes on a plasmid has been reported as a method of producing a hybrid gene. The in vivo recombination of substantially mismatched DNA sequences in a host cell having defective mismatch repair enzymes, resulting in hybrid molecule formation has been reported.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0058">This invention relates generally to the field of nucleic acid engineering and correspondingly encoded recombinant protein engineering. More particularly, the invention relates to the directed evolution of nucleic acids and screening of clones containing the evolved nucleic acids for resultant activity(ies) of interest, such nucleic acid activity(ies) &#x26;/or specified protein, particularly enzyme, activity(ies) of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0059">Mutagenized molecules provided by this invention may have chimeric molecules and molecules with point mutations, including biological molecules that contain a carbohydrate, a lipid, a nucleic acid, &#x26;/or a protein component, and specific but non-limiting examples of these include antibiotics, antibodies, enzymes, and steroidal and non-steroidal hormones.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0060">This invention relates generally to a method of: 1) preparing a progeny generation of molecule(s) (including a molecule that is comprised of a polynucleotide sequence, a molecule that is comprised of a polypeptide sequence, and a molecule that is comprised in part of a polynucleotide sequence and in part of a polypeptide sequence), that is mutagenized to achieve at least one point mutation, addition, deletion, &#x26;/or chimerization, from one or more ancestral or parental generation template(s); 2) screening the progeny generation molecule(s)&#x2014;preferably using a high throughput method&#x2014;for at least one property of interest (such as an improvement in an enzyme activity or an increase in stability or a novel chemotherapeutic effect); 3) optionally obtaining &#x26;/or cataloguing structural &#x26;/or and functional information regarding the parental &#x26;/or progeny generation molecules; and 4) optionally repeating any of steps 1) to 3).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0061">In a preferred embodiment, there is generated (e.g. from a parent polynucleotide template)&#x2014;in what is termed &#x201c;codon site-saturation mutagenesis&#x201d;&#x2014;a progeny generation of polynucleotides, each having at least one set of up to three contiguous point mutations (i.e. different bases comprising a new codon), such that every codon (or every family of degenerate codons encoding the same amino acid) is represented at each codon position. Corresponding to&#x2014;and encoded by&#x2014;this progeny generation of polynucleotides, there is also generated a set of progeny polypeptides, each having at least one single amino acid point mutation. In a preferred aspect, there is generated&#x2014;in what is termed &#x201c;amino acid site-saturation mutagenesis&#x201d;&#x2014;one such mutant polypeptide for each of the 19 naturally encoded polypeptide-forming alpha-amino acid substitutions at each and every amino acid position along the polypeptide. This yields&#x2014;for each and every amino acid position along the parental polypeptide&#x2014;a total of 20 distinct progeny polypeptides including the original amino acid, or potentially more than 21 distinct progeny polypeptides if additional amino acids are used either instead of or in addition to the 20 naturally encoded amino acids</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0062">Thus, in another aspect, this approach is also serviceable for generating mutants containing&#x2014;in addition to &#x26;/or in combination with the 20 naturally encoded polypeptide-forming alpha-amino acids&#x2014;other rare &#x26;/or not naturally-encoded amino acids and amino acid derivatives. In yet another aspect, this approach is also serviceable for generating mutants by the use of&#x2014;in addition to &#x26;/or in combination with natural or unaltered codon recognition systems of suitable hosts&#x2014;altered, mutagenized, &#x26;/or designer codon recognition systems (such as in a host cell with one or more altered tRNA molecules).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0063">In yet another aspect, this invention relates to recombination and more specifically to a method for preparing polynucleotides encoding a polypeptide by a method of in vivo re-assortment of polynucleotide sequences containing regions of partial homology, assembling the polynucleotides to form at least one polynucleotide and screening the polynucleotides for the production of polypeptide(s) having a useful property.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0064">In yet another preferred embodiment, this invention is serviceable for analyzing and cataloguing&#x2014;with respect to any molecular property (e.g. an enzymatic activity) or combination of properties allowed by current technology&#x2014;the effects of any mutational change achieved (including particularly saturation mutagenesis). Thus, a comprehensive method is provided for determining the effect of changing each amino acid in a parental polypeptide into each of at least 19 possible substitutions. This allows each amino acid in a parental polypeptide to be characterized and catalogued according to its spectrum of potential effects on a measurable property of the polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0065">In another aspect, the method of the present invention utilizes the natural property of cells to recombine molecules and/or to mediate reductive processes that reduce the complexity of sequences and extent of repeated or consecutive sequences possessing regions of homology.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0066">It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for generating hybrid polynucleotides encoding biologically active hybrid polypeptides with enhanced activities. In accomplishing these and other objects, there has been provided, in accordance with one aspect of the invention, a method for introducing polynucleotides into a suitable host cell and growing the host cell under conditions that produce a hybrid polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0067">In another aspect of the invention, the invention provides a method for screening for biologically active hybrid polypeptides encoded by hybrid polynucleotides. The present method allows for the identification of biologically active hybrid polypeptides with enhanced biological activities.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0068">According to another aspect of this invention is provided that an important advantage of the synthetic ligation reassembly methods provided herein is that the starting templates that can be aligned and subjected to ligation reassembly are not limited to full length genes. In fact when working with genomic sequences it is often the case that partial gene sequences are obtained, and these can be subjected to ligation reassembly according to this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0069">In an important aspect of this invention, it is appreciated herein that nucleic acid building blocks that are serviceable for this invention can be generated by synthetic means or alternatively by polymerase-based methods either in vivo or in vitro or alternatively by a combination of synthetic means and polymerase-based means. The likelihood of nucleotide incorporation errors is different for each method. Among such errors some may be undesirable at times. For example the presence of a single nucleotide mistake in the generation of up a nucleic acid building block can lead to the undesirable introduction of a stop codon. It is appreciated that several prescreening methods can be used to filter out to undesirable nucleotide incorporation errors. For example the finalized construct can be a fusion product that includes a reporter sequence, such as GFP or a 6&#xd7;His tag <?insert-start id="REI-00009"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 23)<?insert-end id="REI-00009" ?>, that is only generated in the absence of unwanted internal stop codons. It is also appreciated that the selection all of the method by which nucleic acid building blocks are generated can be based upon consideration of the error rates of each method considered.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0070">Furthermore, it is provided that, according to this invention, nucleic acid building blocks may be single-stranded or double-stranded polynucleotides. Thus, ligation reassembly according to this invention may be performed using synthetic as well as non-synthetic nucleic acid building blocks up, or a combination thereof. Moreover both single-stranded and double-stranded polynucleotides may be used in ligation reassembly, either mutually exclusively or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0071">In another aspect of this invention of, it is provided that blunt ended acid building blocks may be used without alteration of the blunt ends or alternatively may be subjected to treatment with an exonuclease, such as Exonuclease III, to create serviceable overhangs up for synthetic ligation couplings of. Such a treatment may be brief and controlled, e.g., by subjecting the working sample of to a temperature at which the Exonuclease III is operable, and then quickly chilling. In all aspects of ligation reassembly, treatment with a ligase such as T4 DNA Ligase is an optional step.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0072">In specific embodiments, the invention provides a method of non-stochastically producing a library of chimeric nucleic acid molecules having an overall assembly order that is chosen by design, which method is comprised of (a) generating by design a plurality of specific synthetic nucleic acid building blocks having serviceable mutually compatible ligatable ends, and (b) assembling these nucleic acid building blocks, such that a designed overall assembly order is achieved; whereby a set of progenitor templates, such as genes (e.g. a family of esterase genes) or genes pathways (e.g. encoding antibiotics) can be shuffled to generate a sizable library of progeny polynucleotide molecules (e.g. 10<sup>100</sup>) and correspondingly encoded polypeptides, and whereby the expression screening of the progeny polynucleotide library provides a means to identify a desirable species that has a desirable property, such as a specific enzymatic activity serviceable for a commercial application.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0073">Also included is a method of non-stochastically producing a library comprised of a defined number of groupings comprised of one or more groupings of chimeric nucleic acid molecules having an overall assembly order that is chosen by design, which method is comprised of (a) generating by design for each grouping a set of specific nucleic acid building blocks having serviceable mutually compatible ligatable ends, and (b) assembling these nucleic acid building blocks according to said groupings, such that a designed overall assembly order is achieved; whereby a set of progenitor templates, such as genes (e.g. a family of esterase genes) or genes pathways (e.g. encoding antibiotics) can be shuffled to generate a sizable library of progeny polynucleotide molecules (e.g. 10<sup>100</sup>) and correspondingly encoded polypeptides, and whereby the expression screening of the progeny polynucleotide library provides a means to identify a desirable species that has a desirable property, such as a specific enzymatic activity serviceable for a commercial application.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0074">Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and the specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Exonuclease Activity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the activity of the enzyme exonuclease III. This is an exemplary enzyme that can be used to shuffle, assemble, reassemble, recombine, and/or concatenate polynucleotide building blocks. The asterisk indicates that the enzyme acts from the 3&#x2032; direction towards the 5&#x2032; direction of the polynucleotide substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Generation of A Nucleic Acid Building Block by Polymerase-Based Amplification. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a method of generating a double-stranded nucleic acid building block with two overhangs using a polymerase-based amplification reaction (e.g., PCR). As illustrated, a first polymerase-based amplification reaction using a first set of primers, F<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>1</sub>, is used to generate a blunt-ended product (labeled Reaction 1, Product 1), which is essentially identical to Product A. A second polymerase-based amplification reaction using a second set of primers, F<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2</sub>, is used to generate a blunt-ended product (labeled Reaction 2, Product 2), which is essentially identical to Product B. These two products are then mixed and allowed to melt and anneal, generating a potentially useful double-stranded nucleic acid building block with two overhangs. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the product with the 3&#x2032; overhangs (Product C) is selected for by nuclease-based degradation of the other 3 products using a 3&#x2032; acting exonuclease, such as exonuclease III. Alternate primers are shown in parenthesis to illustrate serviceable primers may overlap, and additionally that serviceable primers may be of different lengths, as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Unique Overhangs And Unique Couplings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the point that the number of unique overhangs of each size (e.g. the total number of unique overhangs composed of 1 or 2 or 3, etc. nucleotides) exceeds the number of unique couplings that can result from the use of all the unique overhangs of that size. For example, there are 4 unique 3&#x2032; overhangs composed of a single nucleotide, and 4 unique 5&#x2032; overhangs composed of a single nucleotide. Yet the total number of unique couplings that can be made using all the 8 unique single-nucleotide 3&#x2032; overhangs and single-nucleotide 5&#x2032; overhangs is 4, as presented in Panel A. Panel B shows that the number of unique single-nucleotide 3&#x2032; overhangs is greater than the number of unique couplings. Thus, only 2 intrinsically unique couplings exist using single-nucleotide 3&#x2032; overhangs as shown, Panel C shows 4 unique-single nucleotide 5&#x2032; overhangs are possible (i.e. A, C, G, &#x26; T). For each of these there is a complementary 5&#x2032; overhang with which it can pair (i.e., T, G, C, &#x26; A, respectively), as shown. Panel D shows that the number of unique single-nucleotide 5&#x2032; overhangs is greater than the number of unique couplings. Thus, only 2 intrinsically unique couplings exist using single-nucleotide 5&#x2032; overhangs as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. Unique Overall Assembly Order Achieved by Sequentially Coupling the Building Blocks. Awareness of the degeneracy (between the number of unique overhangs and the number of unique couplings) is important in order to avoid the production of degeneracy in the overall assembly order of the finalized nucleic acid. However, a unique overall assembly order can also be achieved&#x2014;despite the use of non-unique couplings&#x2014;by using building blocks having distinct combinations of couplings, and/or by stepping the assembly of the building blocks in a deliberately chosen sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0079">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, Panel A, for example, one could attempt to assemble the following nucleic acid product using the 5 nucleic acid building blocks as shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates the fact that in order to assemble a total of &#x201c;n&#x201d; nucleic acid building blocks, &#x201c;n&#x2212;1&#x201d; couplings are needed. Yet it is sometimes the case that the number of unique couplings available for use is fewer that the &#x201c;n&#x2212;1&#x201d; value. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, Panel B, degeneracy in the overall assembly order of the 5 nucleic acid building blocks would be present if the assembly process were carried out in one step. For example, building block #2 and building block #3 could both couple to building block #1 as shown. Under these, and other, circumstances a stringent non-stochastic overall assembly order can still be achieved by performing the assembly process in sequential steps.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0080">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates a unique overall assembly order could be achieved by sequentially coupling the building blocks in 2 steps (rather than all at once) as shown. In this example, 2 sequential steps are used to achieve a designed overall assembly order for five nucleic acid building blocks. In this illustration the designed overall assembly order for the five nucleic acid building blocks is: 5&#x2032;-(#1-#2-#3-#4-#5)-3&#x2032;, where #1 represents building block number 1, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Unique Couplings Available Using a Two-Nucleotide 3&#x2032; Overhang. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> further illustrates the point that the number of unique overhangs of each size (here, e.g. the total number of unique overhangs composed of 2 nucleotides) exceeds the number of unique couplings that can result from the use of all the unique overhangs of that size. For example, there are 16 unique 3&#x2032; overhangs composed of two nucleotides, and another 16 unique 5&#x2032; overhangs composed of two nucleotides, for a total of 32 as shown. Yet the total number of couplings that are unique and not self-binding that can be made using all the 32 unique double-nucleotide 3&#x2032; overhangs and double-nucleotide 5&#x2032; overhangs is 12. Some apparently unique couplings have &#x201c;identical twins&#x201d; (marked in the same shading), which are visually obvious in this illustration. Still other overhangs contain nucleotide sequences that can self-bind in a palindromic fashion, as shown and labeled in this figure; thus they do not contribute the high stringency to the overall assembly order.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <?insert-start id="REI-00010"  date="20150120" ?>A, B, and C<?insert-end id="REI-00010" ?>. Generation of an Exhaustive Set of Chimeric Combinations by Synthetic Ligation Reassembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> showcases the power of this invention in its ability to generate exhaustively and systematically all possible combinations of the nucleic acid building blocks designed in this example. Particularly large sets (or libraries) of progeny chimeric molecules can be generated. Because this method can be performed exhaustively and systematically, the method application can be repeated by choosing new demarcation points and with correspondingly newly designed nucleic acid building blocks, bypassing the burden of re-generating and re-screening previously examined and rejected molecular species. It is appreciated that, codon wobble can be used to advantage to increase the frequency of a demarcation point. In other words, a particular base can often be substituted into a nucleic acid building block without altering the amino acid encoded by progenitor codon (that is now altered codon) because of codon degeneracy. As illustrated, demarcation points are chosen upon alignment of 8 progenitor templates <?insert-start id="REI-00011"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NOS 1-8: consensus sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9)<?insert-end id="REI-00011" ?>. Nucleic acid building blocks including their overhangs (which are serviceable for the formation of ordered couplings) are then designed and synthesized. In this instance, 18 nucleic acid building blocks are generated based on the sequence of each of the 8 progenitor templates, for a total of 144 nucleic acid building blocks (or double-stranded oligos). Performing the ligation synthesis procedure will then produce a library of progeny molecules comprised of yield of 8<sup>18 </sup>(or over 1.8&#xd7;10<sup>16</sup>) chimeras.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> <?insert-start id="REI-00012"  date="20150120" ?>A, B, C, and D<?insert-end id="REI-00012" ?>. Synthetic genes from oligos: According to one embodiment of this invention, double-stranded nucleic acid building blocks are designed by aligning a plurality of progenitor nucleic acid templates. Preferably these templates contain some homology and some heterology. The nucleic acids may encode related proteins, such as related enzymes, which relationship may be based on function or structure or both. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the alignment of three polynucleotide progenitor templates <?insert-start id="REI-00013"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NOS 10-12, respectively, in order of appearance) <?insert-end id="REI-00013" ?>and the selection of demarcation points (boxed) shared by all the progenitor molecules. In this particular example, the nucleic acid building blocks derived from each of the progenitor templates were chosen to be approximately 30 to 50 nucleotides in length.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Nucleic acid building blocks for synthetic ligation gene reassembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the nucleic acid building blocks from the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The nucleic acid building blocks are shown here in generic cartoon form, with their compatible overhangs, including both 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; overhangs. There are 22 total nucleic acid building blocks derived from each of the 3 progenitor templates. Thus, the ligation synthesis procedure can produce a library of progeny molecules comprised of yield of 3<sup>22 </sup>(or over 3.1&#xd7;10<sup>10</sup>) chimeras.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Addition of Introns by Synthetic Ligation Reassembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows in generic cartoon form that an intron may be introduced into a chimeric progeny molecule by way of a nucleic acid building block. It is appreciated that introns often have consensus sequences at both termini in order to render them operational. It is also appreciated that, in addition to enabling gene splicing, introns may serve an additional purpose by providing sites of homology to other nucleic acids to enable homologous recombination. For this purpose, and potentially others, it may be sometimes desirable to generate a large nucleic acid building block for introducing an intron. If the size is overly large easily generated by direct chemical synthesis of two single stranded oligos, such a specialized nucleic acid building block may also be generated by direct chemical synthesis of more than two single stranded oligos or by using a polymerase-based amplification reaction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Ligation Reassembly Using Fewer Than All The Nucleotides Of An Overhang. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows that coupling can occur in a manner that does not make use of every nucleotide in a participating overhang. The coupling is particularly likely to survive (e.g. in a transformed host) if the coupling reinforced by treatment with a ligase enzyme to form what may be referred to as a &#x201c;gap ligation&#x201d; or a &#x201c;gapped ligation&#x201d;. It is appreciated that, as shown, this type of coupling can contribute to generation of unwanted background product(s), but it can also be used advantageously to increase the diversity of the progeny library generated by the designed ligation reassembly. The example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows ligation of one strand only; the gap in the second strand can be repaired in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Avoidance of unwanted self-ligation in palindromic couplings. As mentioned before and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, certain overhangs are able to undergo self-coupling to form a palindromic coupling. A coupling is strengthened substantially if it is reinforced by treatment with a ligase enzyme. Accordingly, it is appreciated that the lack of 5&#x2032; phosphates on these overhangs, as shown, can be used advantageously to prevent this type of palindromic self-ligation. Accordingly, this invention provides that nucleic acid building blocks can be chemically made (or ordered) that lack a 5&#x2032; phosphate group (or alternatively they can be removed-e.g. by treatment with a phosphatase enzyme such as a calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP)&#x2014;in order to prevent palindromic self-ligations in ligation reassembly processes. This figure shows that there is no self-ligation of end primers with palindromic overhangs.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Pathway Engineering. It is a goal of this invention to provide ways of making new gene pathways using ligation reassembly, optionally with other directed evolution methods such as saturation mutagenesis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a preferred approach that may be taken to achieve this goal. It is appreciated that naturally-occurring microbial gene pathways are linked more often than naturally-occurring eukaryotic (e.g. plant) gene pathways, which are sometime only partially linked. In a particular embodiment, this invention provides that regulatory gene sequences (including promoters) can be introduced in the form of nucleic acid building blocks into progeny gene pathways generated by ligation reassembly processes. Thus, originally linked microbial gene pathways, as well as originally unlinked genes and gene pathways, can be thus converted to acquire operability in plants and other eukaryotes.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Avoidance of unwanted self-ligation in palindromic couplings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates that another goal of this invention, in addition to the generation of novel gene pathways, is the subjection of gene pathways&#x2014;both naturally occurring and man-made&#x2014;to mutagenesis and selection in order to achieve improved progeny molecules using the instantly disclosed methods of directed evolution (including saturation mutagenesis and synthetic ligation reassembly). In a particular embodiment, as provided by the instant invention, both microbial and plant pathways can be improved by directed evolution, and as shown, the directed evolution process can be performed both on genes prior to linking them into pathways, and on gene pathways themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Conversion of Microbial Pathways to Eukaryotic Pathways. In a particular embodiment, this invention provides that microbial pathways can be converted to pathways operable in plants and other eukaryotic species by the introduction of regulatory sequences that function in those species. Preferred regulatory sequences include promoters, operators, and activator binding sites. As shown, a preferred method of achieving the introduction of such serviceable regulatory sequences is in the form of nucleic acid building blocks, particularly through the use of couplings in ligation reassembly processes. These couplings in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> are marked with the letters A, B, C, D and F.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Evolution of polypeptides by synthesizing (in vivo or in vitro) corresponding deduced polynucleotides and subjecting the deduced polynucleotides to directed evolution and expression screening subsequently expressed polypeptides. This invention provides that ligation reassembly and site saturation mutagenesis are each serviceable for introducing nucleotide substitutions as well as nucleotide deletions and nucleotide additions and combinations thereof. Furthermore synthetic ligation reassembly can be performed on a plurality of starting templates as well as on a single template to rearrange the order of the nucleotide cassettes in a non-stochastic predetermined manner. Additionally, when subjecting a plurality of starting templates to ligation reassembly, it is not necessary that the same number of nucleic acid building blocks be generated from each template (e.g. to participate to in each coupling). Thus for example if three templates are used, then a different number of nucleic acid building blocks may be generated corresponding to each template.</p>

N different strains of a virus are used in this illustration, but the technique is applicable to any single nucleic acid as well as to any nucleic acid for which different strains, species, or gene families have homologous nucleic acids that have one or more nucleotide changes compared to other homologous nucleic acids. The different variant nucleic acids are experimentally generated, preferably non-stochastically, as described herein, and screened or selected to identify those variants that exhibit the desired property. The directed evolution method(s) and screening can be repeated one or more times to obtain further improvement. Panel B shows that successive rounds of directed evolution can produce progressively enhanced properties, and that the combination of individual beneficial mutations can lead to an enhanced improvement compared to the improvement achieved by an individual beneficial mutation. This figure illustrates the non-stochastic polynucleotide reassembly in combination with non-stochastic polynucleotide site-saturation mutagenesis.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0097">In order to facilitate understanding of the examples provided herein, certain frequently occurring methods and/or terms will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0098">The term &#x201c;agent&#x201d; is used herein to denote a chemical compound, a mixture of chemical compounds, an array of spatially localized compounds (e.g., a VLSIPS peptide array, polynucleotide array, and/or combinatorial small molecule array), biological macromolecule, a bacteriophage peptide display library, a bacteriophage antibody (e.g., scFv) display library, a polysome peptide display library, or an extract made from biological materials such as bacteria, plants, fungi, or animal (particular mammalian) cells or tissues. Agents are evaluated for potential activity as anti-neoplastics, anti-inflammatories or apoptosis modulators by inclusion in screening assays described herein below. Agents are evaluated for potential activity as specific protein interaction inhibitors (i.e., an agent which selectively inhibits a binding interaction between two predetermined polypeptides but which does not substantially interfere with cell viability) by inclusion in screening assays described herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0099">An &#x201c;ambiguous base requirement&#x201d; in a restriction site refers to a nucleotide base requirement that is not specified to the fullest extent, i.e. that is not a specific base (such as, in a non-limiting exemplification, a specific base selected from A, C, G, and T), but rather may be any one of at least two or more bases. Commonly accepted abbreviations that are used in the art as well as herein to represent ambiguity in bases include the following: R=G or A; Y=C or T; M=A or C; K=G or T; S=G or C; W=A or T; H=A or C or T; B=G or T or C; V=G or C or A; D=G or A or T; N=A or C or G or T.</p>

The &#x201c;twenty naturally encoded polypeptide-forming alpha-amino acids&#x201d; are understood in the art and refer to: alanine (ala or A), arginine (arg or R), asparagine (asn or N), aspartic acid (asp or D), cysteine (cys or C), gluatamic acid (glu or E), glutamine (gln or Q), glycine (gly or G), histidine (his or H), isoleucine (ile or I), leucine (leu or L), lysine (lys or K), methionine (met or M), phenylalanine (phe or F), proline (pro or P), serine (ser or S), threonine (thr or T), tryptophan (trp or W), tyrosine (tyr or Y), and valine (val or V).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0101">The term &#x201c;amplification&#x201d; means that the number of copies of a polynucleotide is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0102">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to intact immunoglobulin molecules, as well as fragments of immunoglobulin molecules, such as Fab, Fab&#x2032;, (Fab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, Fv, and SCA fragments, that are capable of binding to an epitope of an antigen. These antibody fragments, which retain some ability to selectively bind to an antigen (e.g., a polypeptide antigen) of the antibody from which they are derived, can be made using well known methods in the art (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, supra), and are described further, as follows.
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0103">(1) An Fab fragment consists of a monovalent antigen-binding fragment of an antibody molecule, and can be produced by digestion of a whole antibody molecule with the enzyme papain, to yield a fragment consisting of an intact light chain and a portion of a heavy chain.</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0104">(2) An Fab&#x2032; fragment of an antibody molecule can be obtained by treating a whole antibody molecule with pepsin, followed by reduction, to yield a molecule consisting of an intact light chain and a portion of a heavy chain. Two Fab&#x2032; fragments are obtained per antibody molecule treated in this manner.</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0105">(3) An (Fab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment of an antibody can be obtained by treating a whole antibody molecule with the enzyme pepsin, without subsequent reduction. A (Fab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment is a dimer of two Fab&#x2032; fragments, held together by two disulfide bonds.</li>

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0108">The term &#x201c;Applied Molecular Evolution&#x201d; (&#x201c;AME&#x201d;) means the application of an evolutionary design algorithm to a specific, useful goal. While many different library formats for AME have been reported for polynucleotides, peptides and proteins (phage, lacI and polysomes), none of these formats have provided for recombination by random cross-overs to deliberately create a combinatorial library.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0109">A molecule that has a &#x201c;chimeric property&#x201d; is a molecule that is: 1) in part homologous and in part heterologous to a first reference molecule; while 2) at the same time being in part homologous and in part heterologous to a second reference molecule; without 3) precluding the possibility of being at the same time in part homologous and in part heterologous to still one or more additional reference molecules. In a non-limiting embodiment, a chimeric molecule may be prepared by assemblying a reassortment of partial molecular sequences. In a non-limiting aspect, a chimeric polynucleotide molecule may be prepared by synthesizing the chimeric polynucleotide using plurality of molecular templates, such that the resultant chimeric polynucleotide has properties of a plurality of templates.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0110">The term &#x201c;cognate&#x201d; as used herein refers to a gene sequence that is evolutionarily and functionally related between species. For example, but not limitation, in the human genome the human CD4 gene is the cognate gene to the mouse 3d4 gene, since the sequences and structures of these two genes indicate that they are highly homologous and both genes encode a protein which functions in signaling T cell activation through MHC class II-restricted antigen recognition.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0111">A &#x201c;comparison window,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a conceptual segment of at least 20 contiguous nucleotide positions wherein a polynucleotide sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of at least 20 contiguous nucleotides and wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) of 20 percent or less as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for aligning a comparison window may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith (Smith and Waterman, Adv Appl Math, 1981; Smith and Waterman, J Teor Biol, 1981; Smith and Waterman, J Mol Biol, 1981; Smith et al, J Mol Evol, 1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman (Needleman and Wuncsch, 1970), by the search of similarity method of Pearson (Pearson and Lipman, 1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by inspection, and the best alignment (i.e., resulting in the highest percentage of homology over the comparison window) generated by the various methods is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0112">As used herein, the term &#x201c;complementarity-determining region&#x201d; and &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; refer to the art-recognized term as exemplified by the Kabat and Chothia CDR definitions also generally known as supervariable regions or hypervariable loops (Chothia and Lesk, 1987; Clothia et al, 1989; Kabat et al, 1987; and Tramontano et al, 1990). Variable region domains typically comprise the amino-terminal approximately 105-115 amino acids of a naturally-occurring immunoglobulin chain (e.g., amino acids 1-110), although variable domains somewhat shorter or longer are also suitable for forming single-chain antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0113">&#x201c;Conservative amino acid substitutions&#x201d; refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains. For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains is serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is lysine, arginine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur-containing side chains is cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, and asparagine-glutamine.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0114">The term &#x201c;corresponds to&#x201d; is used herein to mean that a polynucleotide sequence is homologous (i.e., is identical, not strictly evolutionarily related) to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence, or that a polypeptide sequence is identical to a reference polypeptide sequence. In contradistinction, the term &#x201c;complementary to&#x201d; is used herein to mean that the complementary sequence is homologous to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence. For illustration, the nucleotide sequence &#x201c;TATAC&#x201d; corresponds to a reference &#x201c;TATAC&#x201d; and is complementary to a reference sequence &#x201c;GTATA.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0115">The term &#x201c;degrading effective&#x201d; amount refers to the amount of enzyme which is required to process at least 50% of the substrate, as compared to substrate not contacted with the enzyme. Preferably, at least 80% of the substrate is degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0116">As used herein, the term &#x201c;defined sequence framework&#x201d; refers to a set of defined sequences that are selected on a non-random basis, generally on the basis of experimental data or structural data; for example, a defined sequence framework may comprise a set of amino acid sequences that are predicted to form a &#x3b2;-sheet structure or may comprise a leucine zipper heptad repeat motif, a zinc-finger domain, among other variations. A &#x201c;defined sequence kemal&#x201d; is a set of sequences which encompass a limited scope of variability. Whereas (1) a completely random 10-mer sequence of the 20 conventional amino acids can be any of (20)<sup>10 </sup>sequences, and (2) a pseudorandom 10-mer sequence of the 20 conventional amino acids can be any of (20)<sup>10 </sup>sequences but will exhibit a bias for certain residues at certain positions and/or overall, (3) a defined sequence kernal is a subset of sequences if each residue position was allowed to be any of the allowable 20 conventional amino acids (and/or allowable unconventional amino/imino acids). A defined sequence kernal generally comprises variant and invariant residue positions and/or comprises variant residue positions which can comprise a residue selected from a defined subset of amino acid residues), and the like, either segmentally or over the entire length of the individual selected library member sequence. Defined sequence kernels can refer to either amino acid sequences or polynucleotide sequences. Of illustration and not limitation, the sequences (NNK)<sub>10 </sub>and (NNM)<sub>10</sub>, wherein N represents A, T, G, or C; K represents G or T; and M represents A or C, are defined sequence kernels.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0117">&#x201c;Digestion&#x201d; of DNA refers to catalytic cleavage of the DNA with a restriction enzyme that acts only at certain sequences in the DNA. The various restriction enzymes used herein are commercially available and their reaction conditions, cofactors and other requirements were used as would be known to the ordinarily skilled artisan. For analytical purposes, typically 1 &#x3bc;g of plasmid or DNA fragment is used with about 2 units of enzyme in about 20 &#x3bc;l of buffer solution. For the purpose of isolating DNA fragments for plasmid construction, typically 5 to 50 &#x3bc;g of DNA are digested with 20 to 250 units of enzyme in a larger volume. Appropriate buffers and substrate amounts for particular restriction enzymes are specified by the manufacturer. Incubation times of about 1 hour at 37&#xb0; C. are ordinarily used, but may vary in accordance with the supplier's instructions. After digestion the reaction is electrophoresed directly on a gel to isolate the desired fragment.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0118">&#x201c;Directional ligation&#x201d; refers to a ligation in which a 5&#x2032; end and a 3&#x2032; end of a polynuclotide are different enough to specify a preferred ligation orientation. For example, an otherwise untreated and undigested PCR product that has two blunt ends will typically be not have a preferred ligation orientation when ligated into a cloning vector digested to produce blunt ends in its multiple cloning site; thus, directional ligation will typically not be displayed under these circumstances. In contrast, directional ligation will typically displayed when a digested PCR product having a 5&#x2032; EcoR I-treated end and a 3&#x2032; BamH I-is ligated into a cloning vector that has a multiple cloning site digested with EcoR I and BamH I.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0119">The term &#x201c;DNA shuffling&#x201d; is used herein to indicate recombination between substantially homologous but non-identical sequences, in some embodiments DNA shuffling may involve crossover via non-homologous recombination, such as via cer/lox and/or flp/frt systems and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0120">As used in this invention, the term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; refers to an antigenic determinant on an antigen, such as a phytase polypeptide, to which the paratope of an antibody, such as an phytase-specific antibody, binds. Antigenic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules, such as amino acids or sugar side chains, and can have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. As used herein &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; refers to that portion of an antigen or other macromolecule capable of forming a binding interaction that interacts with the variable region binding body of an antibody. Typically, such binding interaction is manifested as an intermolecular contact with one or more amino acid residues of a CDR.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0121">The terms &#x201c;fragment&#x201d;, &#x201c;derivative&#x201d; and &#x201c;analog&#x201d; when referring to a reference polypeptide comprise a polypeptide which retains at least one biological function or activity that is at least essentially same as that of the reference polypeptide. Furthermore, the terms &#x201c;fragment&#x201d;, &#x201c;derivative&#x201d; or &#x201c;analog&#x201d; are exemplified by a &#x201c;pro-form&#x201d; molecule, such as a low activity proprotein that can be modified by cleavage to produce a mature enzyme with significantly higher activity.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0122">A method is provided herein for producing from a template polypeptide a set of progeny polypeptides in which a &#x201c;full range of single amino acid substitutions&#x201d; is represented at each amino acid position. As used herein, &#x201c;full range of single amino acid substitutions&#x201d; is in reference to the naturally encoded 20 naturally encoded polypeptide-forming alpha-amino acids, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0123">The term &#x201c;gene&#x201d; means the segment of DNA involved in producing a polypeptide chain; it includes regions preceding and following the coding region (leader and trailer) as well as intervening sequences (introns) between individual coding segments (exons).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0124">&#x201c;Genetic instability&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to the natural tendency of highly repetitive sequences to be lost through a process of reductive events generally involving sequence simplification through the loss of repeated sequences. Deletions tend to involve the loss of one copy of a repeat and everything between the repeats.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0125">The term &#x201c;heterologous&#x201d; means that one single-stranded nucleic acid sequence is unable to hybridize to another single-stranded nucleic acid sequence or its complement. Thus areas of heterology means that areas of polynucleotides or polynucleotides have areas or regions within their sequence which are unable to hybridize to another nucleic acid or polynucleotide. Such regions or areas are for example areas of mutations.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0126">The term &#x201c;homologous&#x201d; or &#x201c;homeologous&#x201d; means that one single-stranded nucleic acid sequence may hybridize to a complementary single-stranded nucleic acid sequence. The degree of hybridization may depend on a number of factors including the amount of identity between the sequences and the hybridization conditions such as temperature and salt concentrations as discussed later. Preferably the region of identity is greater than about 5 bp, more preferably the region of identity is greater than 10 bp.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0127">An immunoglobulin light or heavy chain variable region consists of a &#x201c;framework&#x201d; region interrupted by three hypervariable regions, also called CDR's. The extent of the framework region and CDR's have been precisely defined; see &#x201c;Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest&#x201d; (Kabat et al, 1987). The sequences of the framework regions of different light or heavy chains are relatively conserved within a specie. As used herein, a &#x201c;human framework region&#x201d; is a framework region that is substantially identical (about 85 or more, usually 90-95 or more) to the framework region of a naturally occurring human immunoglobulin. the framework region of an antibody, that is the combined framework regions of the constituent light and heavy chains, serves to position and align the CDR's. The CDR's are primarily responsible for binding to an epitope of an antigen.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0128">The benefits of this invention extend to &#x201c;commercial applications&#x201d; (or commercial processes), which term is used to include applications in commercial industry proper (or simply industry) as well as non-commercial commercial applications (e.g. biomedical research at a non-profit institution). Relevant applications include those in areas of diagnosis, medicine, agriculture, manufacturing, and academia.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0129">The term &#x201c;identical&#x201d; or &#x201c;identity&#x201d; means that two nucleic acid sequences have the same sequence or a complementary sequence. Thus, &#x201c;areas of identity&#x201d; means that regions or areas of a polynucleotide or the overall polynucleotide are identical or complementary to areas of another polynucleotide or the polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0130">The term &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; means that the material is removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring). For example, a naturally-occurring polynucleotide or enzyme present in a living animal is not isolated, but the same polynucleotide or enzyme, separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system, is isolated. Such polynucleotides could be part of a vector and/or such polynucleotides or enzymes could be part of a composition, and still be isolated in that such vector or composition is not part of its natural environment.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0131">By &#x201c;isolated nucleic acid&#x201d; is meant a nucleic acid, e.g., a DNA or RNA molecule, that is not immediately contiguous with the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; flanking sequences with which it normally is immediately contiguous when present in the naturally occurring genome of the organism from which it is derived. The term thus describes, for example, a nucleic acid that is incorporated into a vector, such as a plasmid or viral vector; a nucleic acid that is incorporated into the genome of a heterologous cell (or the genome of a homologous cell, but at a site different from that at which it naturally occurs); and a nucleic acid that exists as a separate molecule, e.g., a DNA fragment produced by PCR amplification or restriction enzyme digestion, or an RNA molecule produced by in vitro transcription. The term also describes a recombinant nucleic acid that forms part of a hybrid gene encoding additional polypeptide sequences that can be used, for example, in the production of a fusion protein.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0132">As used herein &#x201c;ligand&#x201d; refers to a molecule, such as a random peptide or variable segment sequence, that is recognized by a particular receptor. As one of skill in the art will recognize, a molecule (or macromolecular complex) can be both a receptor and a ligand. In general, the binding partner having a smaller molecular weight is referred to as the ligand and the binding partner having a greater molecular weight is referred to as a receptor.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0133">&#x201c;Ligation&#x201d; refers to the process of forming phosphodiester bonds between two double stranded nucleic acid fragments (Sambrook et al, 1982, p. 146; Sambrook, 1989). Unless otherwise provided, ligation may be accomplished using known buffers and conditions with 10 units of T4 DNA ligase (&#x201c;ligase&#x201d;) per 0.5 &#x3bc;g of approximately equimolar amounts of the DNA fragments to be ligated.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0134">As used herein, &#x201c;linker&#x201d; or &#x201c;spacer&#x201d; refers to a molecule or group of molecules that connects two molecules, such as a DNA binding protein and a random peptide, and serves to place the two molecules in a preferred configuration, e.g., so that the random peptide can bind to a receptor with minimal steric hindrance from the DNA binding protein.</p>

Particularly relevant&#x2014;but by no means limiting&#x2014;examples of molecular properties to be evolved include enzymatic activities at specified conditions, such as related to temperature; salinity; pressure; pH; and concentration of glycerol, DMSO, detergent, &#x26;/or any other molecular species with which contact is made in a reaction environment. Additional particularly relevant&#x2014;but by no means limiting&#x2014;examples of molecular properties to be evolved include stabilities&#x2014;e.g. the amount of a residual molecular property that is present after a specified exposure time to a specified environment, such as may be encountered during storage.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0136">The term &#x201c;mutations&#x201d; includes changes in the sequence of a wild-type or parental nucleic acid sequence or changes in the sequence of a peptide. Such mutations may be point mutations such as transitions or transversions. The mutations may be deletions, insertions or duplications. A mutation can also be a &#x201c;chimerization&#x201d;, which is exemplified in a progeny molecule that is generated to contain part or all of a sequence of one parental molecule as well as part or all of a sequence of at least one other parental molecule. This invention provides for both chimeric polynucleotides and chimeric polypeptides.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0137">As used herein, the degenerate &#x201c;N,N,G/T&#x201d; nucleotide sequence represents <b>32</b> possible triplets, where &#x201c;N&#x201d; can be A, C, G or T.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0138">The term &#x201c;naturally-occurring&#x201d; as used herein as applied to the object refers to the fact that an object can be found in nature. For example, a polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory is naturally occurring. Generally, the term naturally occurring refers to an object as present in a non-pathological (un-diseased) individual, such as would be typical for the species.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0139">As used herein, a &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule&#x201d; is comprised of at least one base or one base pair, depending on whether it is single-stranded or double-stranded, respectively. Furthermore, a nucleic acid molecule may belong exclusively or chimerically to any group of nucleotide-containing molecules, as exemplified by, but not limited to, the following groups of nucleic acid molecules: RNA, DNA, genomic nucleic acids, non-genomic nucleic acids, naturally occurring and not naturally occurring nucleic acids, and synthetic nucleic acids. This includes, by way of non-limiting example, nucleic acids associated with any organelle, such as the mitochondria, ribosomal RNA, and nucleic acid molecules comprised chimerically of one or more components that are not naturally occurring along with naturally occurring components.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0140">Additionally, a &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule&#x201d; may contain in part one or more non-nucleotide-based components as exemplified by, but not limited to, amino acids and sugars. Thus, by way of example, but not limitation, a ribozyme that is in part nucleotide-based and in part protein-based is considered a &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0141">In addition, by way of example, but not limitation, a nucleic acid molecule that is labeled with a detectable moiety, such as a radioactive or alternatively a non-radioactive label, is likewise considered a &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule&#x201d;.</p>

A &#x201c;promotor sequence&#x201d; is a DNA regulatory region capable of binding RNA polymerase in a cell and initiating transcription of a downstream (3&#x2032; direction) coding sequence. The promoter is part of the DNA sequence. This sequence region has a start codon at its 3&#x2032; terminus. The promoter sequence does include the minimum number of bases where elements necessary to initiate transcription at levels detectable above background. However, after the RNA polymerase binds the sequence and transcription is initiated at the start codon (3&#x2032; terminus with a promoter), transcription proceeds downstream in the 3&#x2032; direction. Within the promotor sequence will be found a transcription initiation site (conveniently defined by mapping with nuclease S1) as well as protein binding domains (consensus sequences) responsible for the binding of RNA polymerase.</p>

<p id="p-0129" num="0144">In one preferred embodiment, a &#x201c;specific nucleic acid molecule species&#x201d; is defined by its chemical structure, as exemplified by, but not limited to, its primary sequence. In another preferred embodiment, a specific &#x201c;nucleic acid molecule species&#x201d; is defined by a function of the nucleic acid species or by a function of a product derived from the nucleic acid species. Thus, by way of non-limiting example, a &#x201c;specific nucleic acid molecule species&#x201d; may be defined by one or more activities or properties attributable to it, including activities or properties attributable its expressed product.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0145">The instant definition of &#x201c;assembling a working nucleic acid sample into a nucleic acid library&#x201d; includes the process of incorporating a nucleic acid sample into a vector-based collection, such as by ligation into a vector and transformation of a host. A description of relevant vectors, hosts, and other reagents as well as specific non-limiting examples thereof are provided hereinafter. The instant definition of &#x201c;assembling a working nucleic acid sample into a nucleic acid library&#x201d; also includes the process of incorporating a nucleic acid sample into a non-vector-based collection, such as by ligation to adaptors. Preferably the adaptors can anneal to PCR primers to facilitate amplification by PCR.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0146">Accordingly, in a non-limiting embodiment, a &#x201c;nucleic acid library&#x201d; is comprised of a vector-based collection of one or more nucleic acid molecules. In another preferred embodiment a &#x201c;nucleic acid library&#x201d; is comprised of a non-vector-based collection of nucleic acid molecules. In yet another preferred embodiment a &#x201c;nucleic acid library&#x201d; is comprised of a combined collection of nucleic acid molecules that is in part vector-based and in part non-vector-based.

The term &#x201c;construct&#x201d; is used herein to describe a molecule, such as a polynucleotide (e.g., a phytase polynucleotide) may optionally be chemically bonded to one or more additional molecular moieties, such as a vector, or parts of a vector. In a specific&#x2014;but by no means limiting&#x2014;aspect, a nucleotide construct is exemplified by DNA expression constructs suitable for the transformation of a host cell.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0148">An &#x201c;oligonucleotide&#x201d; (or synonymously an &#x201c;oligo&#x201d;) refers to either a single stranded polydeoxynucleotide or two complementary polydeoxynucleotide strands which may be chemically synthesized. Such synthetic oligonucleotides may or may not have a 5&#x2032; phosphate. Those that do not will not ligate to another oligonucleotide without adding a phosphate with an ATP in the presence of a kinase. A synthetic oligonucleotide will ligate to a fragment that has not been dephosphorylated. To achieve polymerase-based amplification (such as with PCR), a &#x201c;32-fold degenerate oligonucleotide that is comprised of, in series, at least a first homologous sequence, a degenerate N,N,G/T sequence, and a second homologous sequence&#x201d; is mentioned. As used in this context, &#x201c;homologous&#x201d; is in reference to homology between the oligo and the parental polynucleotide that is subjected to the polymerase-based amplification.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0149">As used herein, the term &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; refers to a linkage of polynucleotide elements in a functional relationship. A nucleic acid is &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the coding sequence. Operably linked means that the DNA sequences being linked are typically contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein coding regions, contiguous and in reading frame.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0150">A coding sequence is &#x201c;operably linked to&#x201d; another coding sequence when RNA polymerase will transcribe the two coding sequences into a single mRNA, which is then translated into a single polypeptide having amino acids derived from both coding sequences. The coding sequences need not be contiguous to one another so long as the expressed sequences are ultimately processed to produce the desired protein.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0151">As used herein the term &#x201c;parental polynucleotide set&#x201d; is a set comprised of one or more distinct polynucleotide species.

For example, the intracellular conditions in a yeast cell grown under typical laboratory culture conditions are physiological conditions. Suitable in vitro reaction conditions for in vitro transcription cocktails are generally physiological conditions. In general, in vitro physiological conditions comprise 50-200 mM NaCl or KCl, pH 6.5-8.5, 20-45&#xb0; C. and 0.001-10 mM divalent cation (e.g., Mg<sup>++</sup>, Ca<sup>++</sup>); preferably about 150 mM NaCl or KCl, pH 7.2-7.6, 5 mM divalent cation, and often include 0.01-1.0 percent nonspecific protein (e.g., BSA). A non-ionic detergent (Tween, NP-40, Triton X-100) can often be present, usually at about 0.001 to 2%, typically 0.05-0.2% (v/v). Particular aqueous conditions may be selected by the practitioner according to conventional methods. For general guidance, the following buffered aqueous conditions may be applicable: 10-250 mM NaCl, 5-50 mM Tris HCl, pH 5-8, with optional addition of divalent cation(s) and/or metal chelators and/or non-ionic detergents and/or membrane fractions and/or anti-foam agents and/or scintillants.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0153">Standard convention (5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032;) is used herein to describe the sequence of double standed polynucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0154">The term &#x201c;population&#x201d; as used herein means a collection of components such as polynucleotides, portions or polynucleotides or proteins. A &#x201c;mixed population: means a collection of components which belong to the same family of nucleic acids or proteins (i.e., are related) but which differ in their sequence (i.e., are not identical) and hence in their biological activity.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0155">A molecule having a &#x201c;pro-form&#x201d; refers to a molecule that undergoes any combination of one or more covalent and noncovalent chemical modifications (e.g. glycosylation, proteolytic cleavage, dimerization or oligomerization, temperature-induced or pH-induced conformational change, association with a co-factor, etc.) en route to attain a more mature molecular form having a property difference (e.g. an increase in activity) in comparison with the reference proform molecule. When two or more chemical modification (e.g. two proteolytic cleavages, or a proteolytic cleavage and a deglycosylation) can be distinguished en route to the production of a mature molecule, the referemce precursor molecule may be termed a &#x201c;pre-pro-form&#x201d; molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0156">As used herein, the term &#x201c;pseudorandom&#x201d; refers to a set of sequences that have limited variability, such that, for example, the degree of residue variability at another position, but any pseudorandom position is allowed some degree of residue variation, however circumscribed.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0157">&#x201c;Quasi-repeated units&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to the repeats to be re-assorted and are by definition not identical. Indeed the method is proposed not only for practically identical encoding units produced by mutagenesis of the identical starting sequence, but also the reassortment of similar or related sequences which may diverge significantly in some regions. Nevertheless, if the sequences contain sufficient homologies to be reasserted by this approach, they can be referred to as &#x201c;quasi-repeated&#x201d; units.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0158">As used herein &#x201c;random peptide library&#x201d; refers to a set of polynucleotide sequences that encodes a set of random peptides, and to the set of random peptides encoded by those polynucleotide sequences, as well as the fusion proteins contain those random peptides.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0159">As used herein, &#x201c;random peptide sequence&#x201d; refers to an amino acid sequence composed of two or more amino acid monomers and constructed by a stochastic or random process. A random peptide can include framework or scaffolding motifs, which may comprise invariant sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0160">As used herein, &#x201c;receptor&#x201d; refers to a molecule that has an affinity for a given ligand. Receptors can be naturally occurring or synthetic molecules. Receptors can be employed in an unaltered state or as aggregates with other species. Receptors can be attached, covalently or non-covalently, to a binding member, either directly or via a specific binding substance. Examples of receptors include, but are not limited to, antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies and antisera reactive with specific antigenic determinants (such as on viruses, cells, or other materials), cell membrane receptors, complex carbohydrates and glycoproteins, enzymes, and hormone receptors.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0161">&#x201c;Recombinant&#x201d; enzymes refer to enzymes produced by recombinant DNA techniques, i.e., produced from cells transformed by an exogenous DNA construct encoding the desired enzyme. &#x201c;Synthetic&#x201d; enzymes are those prepared by chemical synthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0162">The term &#x201c;related polynucleotides&#x201d; means that regions or areas of the polynucleotides are identical and regions or areas of the polynucleotides are heterologous.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0163">&#x201c;Reductive reassortment&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to the increase in molecular diversity that is accrued through deletion (and/or insertion) events that are mediated by repeated sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0164">The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between two or more polynucleotides: &#x201c;reference sequence,&#x201d; &#x201c;comparison window,&#x201d; &#x201c;sequence identity,&#x201d; &#x201c;percentage of sequence identity,&#x201d; and &#x201c;substantial identity.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0165">A &#x201c;reference sequence&#x201d; is a defined sequence used as a basis for a sequence comparison; a reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence, for example, as a segment of a full-length cDNA or gene sequence given in a sequence listing, or may comprise a complete cDNA or gene sequence. Generally, a reference sequence is at least nucleotides in length, frequently at least 25 nucleotides in length, and often at least 50 nucleotides in length. Since two polynucleotides may each (1) comprise a sequence (i.e., a portion of the complete polynucleotide sequence) that is similar between the two polynucleotides and (2) may further comprise a sequence that is divergent between the two polynucleotides, sequence comparisons between two (or more) polynucleotides are typically performed by comparing sequences of the two polynucleotides over a &#x201c;comparison window&#x201d; to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0166">&#x201c;Repetitive Index (RI)&#x201d;, as used herein, is the average number of copies of the quasi-repeated units contained in the cloning vector.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0167">The term &#x201c;restriction site&#x201d; refers to a recognition sequence that is necessary for the manifestation of the action of a restriction enzyme, and includes a site of catalytic cleavage. It is appreciated that a site of cleavage may or may not be contained within a portion of a restriction site that comprises a low ambiguity sequence (i.e. a sequence containing the principal determinant of the frequency of occurrence of the restriction site). Thus, in many cases, relevant restriction sites contain only a low ambiguity sequence with an internal cleavage site (e.g. G/AATTC in the EcoR I site) or an immediately adjacent cleavage site (e.g. /CCWGG in the EcoR II site). In other cases, relevant restriction enzymes [e.g. the Eco57 I site or CTGAAG(16/14) <?insert-start id="REI-00020"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 24)<?insert-end id="REI-00020" ?>] contain a low ambiguity sequence (e.g. the CTGAAG sequence in the Eco57 I site) with an external cleavage site (e.g. in the N<sub>16 </sub>portion of the Eco57 I site). When an enzyme (e.g. a restriction enzyme) is said to &#x201c;cleave&#x201d; a polynucleotide, it is understood to mean that the restriction enzyme catalyzes or facilitates a cleavage of a polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0168">In a non-limiting aspect, a &#x201c;selectable polynucleotide&#x201d; is comprised of a 5&#x2032; terminal region (or end region), an intermediate region (i.e. an internal or central region), and a 3&#x2032; terminal region (or end region). As used in this aspect, a 5&#x2032; terminal region is a region that is located towards a 5&#x2032; polynucleotide terminus (or a 5&#x2032; polynucleotide end); thus it is either partially or entirely in a 5&#x2032; half of a polynucleotide. Likewise, a 3&#x2032; terminal region is a region that is located towards a 3&#x2032; polynucleotide terminus (or a 3&#x2032; polynucleotide end); thus it is either partially or entirely in a 3&#x2032; half of a polynucleotide. As used in this non-limiting exemplification, there may be sequence overlap between any two regions or even among all three regions.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0169">The term &#x201c;sequence identity&#x201d; means that two polynucleotide sequences are identical (i.e., on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide basis) over the window of comparison. The term &#x201c;percentage of sequence identity&#x201d; is calculated by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over the window of comparison, determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base (e.g., A, T, C, G, U, or I) occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison (i.e., the window size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. This &#x201c;substantial identity&#x201d;, as used herein, denotes a characteristic of a polynucleotide sequence, wherein the polynucleotide comprises a sequence having at least 80 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 85 percent identity, often 90 to 95 percent sequence identity, and most commonly at least 99 percent sequence identity as compared to a reference sequence of a comparison window of at least 25-50 nucleotides, wherein the percentage of sequence identity is calculated by comparing the reference sequence to the polynucleotide sequence which may include deletions or additions which total 20 percent or less of the reference sequence over the window of comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0170">As known in the art &#x201c;similarity&#x201d; between two enzymes is determined by comparing the amino acid sequence and its conserved amino acid substitutes of one enzyme to the sequence of a second enzyme. Similarity may be determined by procedures which are well-known in the art, for example, a BLAST program (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool at the National Center for Biological Information).</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0171">As used herein, the term &#x201c;single-chain antibody&#x201d; refers to a polypeptide comprising a V<sub>H </sub>domain and a V<sub>L </sub>domain in polypeptide linkage, generall linked via a spacer peptide (e.g., [Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser]<sub>x </sub><?insert-start id="REI-00021"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 25)<?insert-end id="REI-00021" ?>), and which may comprise additional amino acid sequences at the amino- and/or carboxy-termini. For example, a single-chain antibody may comprise a tether segment for linking to the encoding polynucleotide. As an example, a scFv is a single-chain antibody. Single-chain antibodies are generally proteins consisting of one or more polypeptide segments of at least 10 contiguous amino substantially encoded by genes of the immunoglobulin superfamily (e.g., see Williams and Barclay, 1989, pp. 361-368, which is incorporated herein by reference), most frequently encoded by a rodent, non-human primate, avian, porcine bovine, ovine, goat, or human heavy chain or light chain gene sequence. A functional single-chain antibody generally contains a sufficient portion of an immunoglobulin superfamily gene product so as to retain the property of binding to a specific target molecule, typically a receptor or antigen (epitope).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0172">The members of a pair of molecules (e.g., an antibody-antigen pair or a nucleic acid pair) are said to &#x201c;specifically bind&#x201d; to each other if they bind to each other with greater affinity than to other, non-specific molecules. For example, an antibody raised against an antigen to which it binds more efficiently than to a non-specific protein can be described as specifically binding to the antigen. (Similarly, a nucleic acid probe can be described as specifically binding to a nucleic acid target if it forms a specific duplex with the target by base pairing interactions (see above).)</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0173">&#x201c;Specific hybridization&#x201d; is defined herein as the formation of hybrids between a first polynucleotide and a second polynucleotide (e.g., a polynucleotide having a distinct but substantially identical sequence to the first polynucleotide), wherein substantially unrelated polynucleotide sequences do not form hybrids in the mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0174">The term &#x201c;specific polynucleotide&#x201d; means a polynucleotide having certain end points and having a certain nucleic acid sequence. Two polynucleotides wherein one polynucleotide has the identical sequence as a portion of the second polynucleotide but different ends comprises two different specific polynucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0175">&#x201c;Stringent hybridization conditions&#x201d; means hybridization will occur only if there is at least 90% identity, preferably at least 95% identity and most preferably at least 97% identity between the sequences. See Sambrook et al, 1989, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0176">Also included in the invention are polypeptides having sequences that are &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; to the sequence of a phytase polypeptide, such as one of SEQ ID 1. A &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; amino acid sequence is a sequence that differs from a reference sequence only by conservative amino acid substitutions, for example, substitutions of one amino acid for another of the same class (e.g., substitution of one hydrophobic amino acid, such as isoleucine, valine, leucine, or methionine, for another, or substitution of one polar amino acid for another, such as substitution of arginine for lysine, glutamic acid for aspartic acid, or glutamine for asparagine).</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0177">Additionally a &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; amino acid sequence is a sequence that differs from a reference sequence or by one or more non-conservative substitutions, deletions, or insertions, particularly when such a substitution occurs at a site that is not the active site the molecule, and provided that the polypeptide essentially retains its behavioural properties. For example, one or more amino acids can be deleted from a phytase polypeptide, resulting in modification of the structure of the polypeptide, without significantly altering its biological activity. For example, amino- or carboxyl-terminal amino acids that are not required for phytase biological activity can be removed. Such modifications can result in the development of smaller active phytase polypeptides.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0178">The present invention provides a &#x201c;substantially pure enzyme&#x201d;. The term &#x201c;substantially pure enzyme&#x201d; is used herein to describe a molecule, such as a polypeptide (e.g., a phytase polypeptide, or a fragment thereof) that is substantially free of other proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and other biological materials with which it is naturally associated. For example, a substantially pure molecule, such as a polypeptide, can be at least 60%, by dry weight, the molecule of interest. The purity of the polypeptides can be determined using standard methods including, e.g., polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (e.g., SDS-PAGE), column chromatography (e.g., high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)), and amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0179">As used herein, &#x201c;substantially pure&#x201d; means an object species is the predominant species present (i.e., on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other individual macromolecular species in the composition), and preferably substantially purified fraction is a composition wherein the object species comprises at least about 50 percent (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species present. Generally, a substantially pure composition will comprise more than about 80 to 90 percent of all macromolecular species present in the composition. Most preferably, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity (contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods) wherein the composition consists essentially of a single macromolecular species. Solvent species, small molecules (&#x3c;500 Daltons), and elemental ion species are not considered macromolecular species.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0180">As used herein, the term &#x201c;variable segment&#x201d; refers to a portion of a nascent peptide which comprises a random, pseudorandom, or defined kernal sequence. A variable segment&#x201d; refers to a portion of a nascent peptide which comprises a random pseudorandom, or defined kernal sequence. A variable segment can comprise both variant and invariant residue positions, and the degree of residue variation at a variant residue position may be limited: both options are selected at the discretion of the practitioner. Typically, variable segments are about 5 to 20 amino acid residues in length (e.g., 8 to 10), although variable segments may be longer and may comprise antibody portions or receptor proteins, such as an antibody fragment, a nucleic acid binding protein, a receptor protein, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0181">The term &#x201c;wild-type&#x201d; means that the polynucleotide does not comprise any mutations. A &#x201c;wild type&#x201d; protein means that the protein will be active at a level of activity found in nature and will comprise the amino acid sequence found in nature.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0182">The term &#x201c;working&#x201d;, as in &#x201c;working sample&#x201d;, for example, is simply a sample with which one is working. Likewise, a &#x201c;working molecule&#x201d;, for example is a molecule with which one is working.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0168" num="0183">The invention described herein is directed to the use of repeated cycles of reductive reassortment, recombination and selection which allow for the directed molecular evolution of highly complex linear sequences, such as DNA, RNA or proteins thorough recombination.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0184">In vivo shuffling of molecules can be performed utilizing the natural property of cells to recombine multimers. While recombination in vivo has provided the major natural route to molecular diversity, genetic recombination remains a relatively complex process that involves 1) the recognition of homologies; 2) strand cleavage, strand invasion, and metabolic steps leading to the production of recombinant chiasma; and finally 3) the resolution of chiasma into discrete recombined molecules. The formation of the chiasma requires the recognition of homologous sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0185">In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a method for producing a hybrid polynucleotide from at least a first polynucleotide and a second polynucleotide. The present invention can be used to produce a hybrid polynucleotide by introducing at least a first polynucleotide and a second polynucleotide which share at least one region of partial sequence homology into a suitable host cell. The regions of partial sequence homology promote processes which result in sequence reorganization producing a hybrid polynucleotide. The term &#x201c;hybrid polynucleotide&#x201d;, as used herein, is any nucleotide sequence which results from the method of the present invention and contains sequence from at least two original polynucleotide sequences. Such hybrid polynucleotides can result from intermolecular recombination events which promote sequence integration between DNA molecules. In addition, such hybrid polynucleotides can result from intramolecular reductive reassortment processes which utilize repeated sequences to alter a nucleotide sequence within a DNA molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0186">The invention provides a means for generating hybrid polynucleotides which may encode biologically active hybrid polypeptides. In one aspect, the original polynucleotides encode biologically active polypeptides. The method of the invention produces new hybrid polypeptides by utilizing cellular processes which integrate the sequence of the original polynucleotides such that the resulting hybrid polynucleotide encodes a polypeptide demonstrating activities derived from the original biologically active polypeptides. For example, the original polynucleotides may encode a particular enzyme from different microorganisms. An enzyme encoded by a first polynucleotide from one organism may, for example, function effectively under a particular environmental condition, e.g. high salinity. An enzyme encoded by a second polynucleotide from a different organism may function effectively under a different environmental condition, such as extremely high temperatures. A hybrid polynucleotide containing sequences from the first and second original polynucleotides may encode an enzyme which exhibits characteristics of both enzymes encoded by the original polynucleotides. Thus, the enzyme encoded by the hybrid polynucleotide may function effectively under environmental conditions shared by each of the enzymes encoded by the first and second polynucleotides, e.g., high salinity and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0187">Enzymes encoded by the original polynucleotides of the invention include, but are not limited to; oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases and ligases. A hybrid polypeptide resulting from the method of the invention may exhibit specialized enzyme activity not displayed in the original enzymes. For example, following recombination and/or reductive reassortment of polynucleotides encoding hydrolase activities, the resulting hybrid polypeptide encoded by a hybrid polynucleotide can be screened for specialized hydrolase activities obtained from each of the original enzymes, i.e. the type of bond on which the hydrolase acts and the temperature at which the hydrolase functions. Thus, for example, the hydrolase may be screened to ascertain those chemical functionalities which distinguish the hybrid hydrolase from the original hydrolyases, such as: (a) amide (peptide bonds), i.e. proteases; (b) ester bonds, i.e. esterases and lipases; (c) acetals, i.e., glycosidases and, for example, the temperature, pH or salt concentration at which the hybrid polypeptide functions.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0188">Sources of the original polynucleotides may be isolated from individual organisms (&#x201c;isolates&#x201d;), collections of organisms that have been grown in defined media (&#x201c;enrichment cultures&#x201d;), or, most preferably, uncultivated organisms (&#x201c;environmental samples&#x201d;). The use of a culture-independent approach to derive polynucleotides encoding novel bioactivities from environmental samples is most preferable since it allows one to access untapped resources of biodiversity.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0189">&#x201c;Environmental libraries&#x201d; are generated from environmental samples and represent the collective genomes of naturally occurring organisms archived in cloning vectors that can be propagated in suitable prokaryotic hosts. Because the cloned DNA is initially extracted directly from environmental samples, the libraries are not limited to the small fraction of prokaryotes that can be grown in pure culture. Additionally, a normalization of the environmental DNA present in these samples could allow more equal representation of the DNA from all of the species present in the original sample. This can dramatically increase the efficiency of finding interesting genes from minor constituents of the sample which may be under-represented by several orders of magnitude compared to the dominant species.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0190">For example, gene libraries generated from one or more uncultivated microorganisms are screened for an activity of interest. Potential pathways encoding bioactive molecules of interest are first captured in prokaryotic cells in the form of gene expression libraries. Polynucleotides encoding activities of interest are isolated from such libraries and introduced into a host cell. The host cell is grown under conditions which promote recombination and/or reductive reassortment creating potentially active biomolecules with novel or enhanced activities.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0191">The microorganisms from which the polynucleotide may be prepared include prokaryotic microorganisms, such as Eubacteria and Archaebacteria, and lower eukaryotic microorganisms such as fungi, some algae and protozoa. Polynucleotides may be isolated from environmental samples in which case the nucleic acid may be recovered without culturing of an organism or recovered from one or more cultured organisms. In one aspect, such microorganisms may be extremophiles, such as hyperthermophiles, psychrophiles, psychrotrophs, halophiles, barophiles and acidophiles. Polynucleotides encoding enzymes isolated from extremophilic microorganisms are particularly preferred. Such enzymes may function at temperatures above 100&#xb0; C. in terrestrial hot springs and deep sea thermal vents, at temperatures below 0&#xb0; C. in arctic waters, in the saturated salt environment of the Dead Sea, at pH values around 0 in coal deposits and geothermal sulfur-rich springs, or at pH values greater than 11 in sewage sludge. For example, several esterases and lipases cloned and expressed from extremophilic organisms show high activity throughout a wide range of temperatures and pHs.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0192">Polynucleotides selected and isolated as hereinabove described are introduced into a suitable host cell. A suitable host cell is any cell which is capable of promoting recombination and/or reductive reassortment. The selected polynucleotides are preferably already in a vector which includes appropriate control sequences. The host cell can be a higher eukaryotic cell, such as a mammalian cell, or a lower eukaryotic cell, such as a yeast cell, or preferably, the host cell can be a prokaryotic cell, such as a bacterial cell. Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-Dextran mediated transfection, or electroporation (Davis et al, 1986).</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0193">As representative examples of appropriate hosts, there may be mentioned: bacterial cells, such as E. coli, Streptomyces, Salmonella typhimurium; fungal cells, such as yeast; insect cells such as Drosophila S2 and Spodoptera Sf9; animal cells such as CHO, COS or Bowes melanoma; adenoviruses; and plant cells. The selection of an appropriate host is deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0194">With particular references to various mammalian cell culture systems that can be employed to express recombinant protein, examples of mammalian expression systems include the COS-7 lines of monkey kidney fibroblasts, described in &#x201c;SV40-transformed simian cells support the replication of early SV40 mutants&#x201d; (Gluzman, 1981), and other cell lines capable of expressing a compatible vector, for example, the C127, 3T3, CHO, HeLa and BHK cell lines. Mammalian expression vectors will comprise an origin of replication, a suitable promoter and enhancer, and also any necessary ribosome binding sites, polyadenylation site, splice donor and acceptor sites, transcriptional termination sequences, and 5&#x2032; flanking nontranscribed sequences. DNA sequences derived from the SV40 splice, and polyadenylation sites may be used to provide the required nontranscribed genetic elements.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0195">Host cells containing the polynucleotides of interest can be cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for activating promoters, selecting transformants or amplifying genes. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan. The clones which are identified as having the specified enzyme activity may then be sequenced to identify the polynucleotide sequence encoding an enzyme having the enhanced activity.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0196">In another aspect, it is envisioned the method of the present invention can be used to generate novel polynucleotides encoding biochemical pathways from one or more operons or gene clusters or portions thereof. For example, bacteria and many eukaryotes have a coordinated mechanism for regulating genes whose products are involved in related processes. The genes are clustered, in structures referred to as &#x201c;gene clusters,&#x201d; on a single chromosome and are transcribed together under the control of a single regulatory sequence, including a single promoter which initiates transcription of the entire cluster. Thus, a gene cluster is a group of adjacent genes that are either identical or related, usually as to their function. An example of a biochemical pathway encoded by gene clusters are polyketides. Polyketides are molecules which are an extremely rich source of bioactivities, including antibiotics (such as tetracyclines and erythromycin), anti-cancer agents (daunomycin), immunosuppressants (FK506 and rapamycin), and veterinary products (monensin). Many polyketides (produced by polyketide synthases) are valuable as therapeutic agents. Polyketide synthases are multifunctional enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of an enormous variety of carbon chains differing in length and patterns of functionality and cyclization. Polyketide synthase genes fall into gene clusters and at least one type (designated type I) of polyketide synthases have large size genes and enzymes, complicating genetic manipulation and in vitro studies of these genes/proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0197">The ability to select and combine desired components from a library of polyketides, or fragments thereof, and postpolyketide biosynthesis genes for generation of novel polyketides for study is appealing. The method of the present invention makes it possible to facilitate the production of novel polyketide synthases through intermolecular recombination.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0198">Preferably, gene cluster DNA can be isolated from different organisms and ligated into vectors, particularly vectors containing expression regulatory sequences which can control and regulate the production of a detectable protein or protein-related array activity from the ligated gene clusters. Use of vectors which have an exceptionally large capacity for exogenous DNA introduction are particularly appropriate for use with such gene clusters and are described by way of example herein to include the f-factor (or fertility factor) of E. coli. This f-factor of E. coli is a plasmid which affect high-frequency transfer of itself during conjugation and is ideal to achieve and stably propagate large DNA fragments, such as gene clusters from mixed microbial samples. Once ligated into an appropriate vector, two or more vectors containing different polyketide synthase gene clusters can be introduced into a suitable host cell. Regions of partial sequence homology shared by the gene clusters will promote processes which result in sequence reorganization resulting in a hybrid gene cluster. The novel hybrid gene cluster can then be screened for enhanced activities not found in the original gene clusters.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0199">Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for producing a biologically active hybrid polypeptide and screening such a polypeptide for enhanced activity by:

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0205">Methods for screening for various enzyme activities are known to those of skill in the art and discussed throughout the present specification. Such methods may be employed when isolating the polypeptides and polynucleotides of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0206">As representative examples of expression vectors which may be used there may be mentioned viral particles, baculovirus, phage, plasmids, phagemids, cosmids, fosmids, bacterial artificial chromosomes, viral DNA (e.g. vaccinia, adenovirus, foul pox virus, pseudorabies and derivatives of SV40), P1-based artificial chromosomes, yeast plasmids, yeast artificial chromosomes, and any other vectors specific for specific hosts of interest (such as bacillus, aspergillus and yeast). Thus, for example, the DNA may be included in any one of a variety of expression vectors for expressing a polypeptide. Such vectors include chromosomal, nonchromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences. Large numbers of suitable vectors are known to those of skill in the art, and are commercially available. The following vectors are provided by way of example; Bacterial: pQE vectors (Qiagen), pBluescript plasmids, pNH vectors, (lambda-ZAP vectors (Stratagene); ptrc99a, pKK223-3, pDR540, pRIT2T (Pharmacia); Eukaryotic: pXT1, pSG5 (Stratagene), pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG, pSVLSV40 (Pharmacia). However, any other plasmid or other vector may be used as long as they are replicable and viable in the host. Low copy number or high copy number vectors may be employed with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0207">A preferred type of vector for use in the present invention contains an f-factor origin replication. The f-factor (or fertility factor) in E. coli is a plasmid which effects high frequency transfer of itself during conjugation and less frequent transfer of the bacterial chromosome itself. A particularly preferred embodiment is to use cloning vectors, referred to as &#x201c;fosmids&#x201d; or bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vectors. These are derived from E. coli f-factor which is able to stably integrate large segments of genomic DNA. When integrated with DNA from a mixed uncultured environmental sample, this makes it possible to achieve large genomic fragments in the form of a stable &#x201c;environmental DNA library.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0208">Another preferred type of vector for use in the present invention is a cosmid vector. Cosmid vectors were originally designed to clone and propagate large segments of genomic DNA. Cloning into cosmid vectors is described in detail in &#x201c;Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual&#x201d; (Sambrook et al, 1989).</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0209">The DNA sequence in the expression vector is operatively linked to an appropriate expression control sequence(s) (promoter) to direct RNA synthesis. Particular named bacterial promoters include lacI, lacZ, T3, T7, gpt, lambda P<sub>R</sub>, P<sub>L </sub>and trp. Eukaryotic promoters include CMV immediate early, HSV thymidine kinase, early and late SV40, LTRs from retrovirus, and mouse metallothionein-I. Selection of the appropriate vector and promoter is well within the level of ordinary skill in the art. The expression vector also contains a ribosome binding site for translation initiation and a transcription terminator. The vector may also include appropriate sequences for amplifying expression. Promoter regions can be selected from any desired gene using CAT (chloramphenicol transferase) vectors or other vectors with selectable markers.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0210">In addition, the expression vectors preferably contain one or more selectable marker genes to provide a phenotypic trait for selection of transformed host cells such as dihydrofolate reductase or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture, or such as tetracycline or ampicillin resistance in E. coli.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0211">Generally, recombinant expression vectors will include origins of replication and selectable markers permitting transformation of the host cell, e.g., the ampicillin resistance gene of E. coli and S. cerevisiae TRP1 gene, and a promoter derived from a highly-expressed gene to direct transcription of a downstream structural sequence. Such promoters can be derived from operons encoding glycolytic enzymes such as 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), &#x3b1;-factor, acid phosphatase, or heat shock proteins, among others. The heterologous structural sequence is assembled in appropriate phase with translation initiation and termination sequences, and preferably, a leader sequence capable of directing secretion of translated protein into the periplasmic space or extracellular medium.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0212">The cloning strategy permits expression via both vector driven and endogenous promoters; vector promotion may be important with expression of genes whose endogenous promoter will not function in E. coli.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0213">The DNA isolated or derived from microorganisms can preferably be inserted into a vector or a plasmid prior to probing for selected DNA. Such vectors or plasmids are preferably those containing expression regulatory sequences, including promoters, enhancers and the like. Such polynucleotides can be part of a vector and/or a composition and still be isolated, in that such vector or composition is not part of its natural environment. Particularly preferred phage or plasmid and methods for introduction and packaging into them are described in detail in the protocol set forth herein.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0214">The selection of the cloning vector depends upon the approach taken, for example, the vector can be any cloning vector with an adequate capacity to multiply repeated copies of a sequence, or multiple sequences that can be successfully transformed and selected in a host cell. One example of such a vector is described in &#x201c;Polycos vectors: a system for packaging filamentous phage and phagemid vectors using lambda phage packaging extracts&#x201d; (Alting-Mecs and Short, 1993). Propagation/maintenance can be by an antibiotic resistance carried by the cloning vector. After a period of growth, the naturally abbreviated molecules are recovered and identified by size fractionation on a gel or column, or amplified directly. The cloning vector utilized may contain a selectable gene that is disrupted by the insertion of the lengthy construct. As reductive reassortment progresses, the number of repeated units is reduced and the interrupted gene is again expressed and hence selection for the processed construct can be applied. The vector may be an expression/selection vector which will allow for the selection of an expressed product possessing desirable biologically properties. The insert may be positioned downstream of a functional promotor and the desirable property screened by appropriate means.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0215">In vivo reassortment is focused on &#x201c;inter-molecular&#x201d; processes collectively referred to as &#x201c;recombination&#x201d; which in bacteria, is generally viewed as a &#x201c;RecA-dependent&#x201d; phenomenon. The present invention can rely on recombination processes of a host cell to recombine and re-assort sequences, or the cells' ability to mediate reductive processes to decrease the complexity of quasi-repeated sequences in the cell by deletion. This process of &#x201c;reductive reassortment&#x201d; occurs by an &#x201c;intra-molecular&#x201d;, RecA-independent process.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0216">Therefore, in another aspect of the present invention, novel polynucleotides can be generated by the process of reductive reassortment. The method involves the generation of constructs containing consecutive sequences (original encoding sequences), their insertion into an appropriate vector, and their subsequent introduction into an appropriate host cell. The reassortment of the individual molecular identities occurs by combinatorial processes between the consecutive sequences in the construct possessing regions of homology, or between quasi-repeated units. The reassertment process recombines and/or reduces the complexity and extent of the repeated sequences, and results in the production of novel molecular species. Various treatments may be applied to enhance the rate of reassortment. These could include treatment with ultra-violet light, or DNA damaging chemicals, and/or the use of host cell lines displaying enhanced levels of &#x201c;genetic instability&#x201d;. Thus the reassortment process may involve homologous recombination or the natural property of quasi-repeated sequences to direct their own evolution.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0217">Repeated or &#x201c;quasi-repeated&#x201d; sequences play a role in genetic instability. In the present invention, &#x201c;quasi-repeats&#x201d; are repeats that are not restricted to their original unit structure. Quasi-repeated units can be presented as an array of sequences in a construct; consecutive units of similar sequences. Once ligated, the junctions between the consecutive sequences become essentially invisible and the quasi-repetitive nature of the resulting construct is now continuous at the molecular level. The deletion process the cell performs to reduce the complexity of the resulting construct operates between the quasi-repeated sequences. The quasi-repeated units provide a practically limitless repertoire of templates upon which slippage events can occur. The constructs containing the quasi-repeats thus effectively provide sufficient molecular elasticity that deletion (and potentially insertion) events can occur virtually anywhere within the quasi-repetitive units.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0218">When the quasi-repeated sequences are all ligated in the same orientation, for instance head to tail or vice versa, the cell cannot distinguish individual units. Consequently, the reductive process can occur throughout the sequences. In contrast, when for example, the units are presented head to head, rather than head to tail, the inversion delineates the endpoints of the adjacent unit so that deletion formation will favor the loss of discrete units. Thus, it is preferable with the present method that the sequences are in the same orientation. Random orientation of quasi-repeated sequences will result in the loss of reassortment efficiency, while consistent orientation of the sequences will offer the highest efficiency. However, while having fewer of the contiguous sequences in the same orientation decreases the efficiency, it may still provide sufficient elasticity for the effective recovery of novel molecules. Constructs can be made with the quasi-repeated sequences in the same orientation to allow higher efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0219">Sequences can be assembled in a head to tail orientation using any of a variety of methods, including the following:
<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0220">a) Primers that include a poly-A head and poly-T tail which when made single-stranded would provide orientation can be utilized. This is accomplished by having the first few bases of the primers made from RNA and hence easily removed RNAseH.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0221">b) Primers that include unique restriction cleavage sites can be utilized. Multiple sites, a battery of unique sequences, and repeated synthesis and ligation steps would be required.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0222">c) The inner few bases of the primer could be thiolated and an exonuclease used to produce properly tailed molecules.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0223">The recovery of the re-assorted sequences relies on the identification of cloning vectors with a reduced RI. The re-assorted encoding sequences can then be recovered by amplification. The products are re-cloned and expressed. The recovery of cloning vectors with reduced RI can be effected by:
<ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0224">1) The use of vectors only stably maintained when the construct is reduced in complexity.</li>
    <li id="ul0011-0002" num="0225">2) The physical recovery of shortened vectors by physical procedures. In this case, the cloning vector would be recovered using standard plasmid isolation procedures and size fractionated on either an agarose gel, or column with a low molecular weight cut off utilizing standard procedures.</li>
    <li id="ul0011-0003" num="0226">3) The recovery of vectors containing interrupted genes which can be selected when insert size decreases.</li>
    <li id="ul0011-0004" num="0227">4) The use of direct selection techniques with an expression vector and the appropriate selection.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0228">Encoding sequences (for example, genes) from related organisms may demonstrate a high degree of homology and encode quite diverse protein products. These types of sequences are particularly useful in the present invention as quasi-repeats. However, while the examples illustrated below demonstrate the reassortment of nearly identical original encoding sequences (quasi-repeats), this process is not limited to such nearly identical repeats.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0229">The following example demonstrates the method of the invention. Encoding nucleic acid sequences (quasi-repeats) derived from three (3) unique species are depicted. Each sequence encodes a protein with a distinct set of properties. Each of the sequences differs by a single or a few base pairs at a unique position in the sequence which are designated &#x201c;A&#x201d;, &#x201c;B&#x201d; and &#x201c;C&#x201d;. The quasi-repeated sequences are separately or collectively amplified and ligated into random assemblies such that all possible permutations and combinations are available in the population of ligated molecules. The number of quasi-repeat units can be controlled by the assembly conditions. The average number of quasi-repeated units in a construct is defined as the repetitive index (RI).</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0230">Once formed, the constructs may, or may not be size fractionated on an agarose gel according to published protocols, inserted into a cloning vector, and transfected into an appropriate host cell. The cells are then propagated and &#x201c;reductive reassortment&#x201d; is effected. The rate of the reductive reassortment process may be stimulated by the introduction of DNA damage if desired. Whether the reduction in RI is mediated by deletion formation between repeated sequences by an &#x201c;intra-molecular&#x201d; mechanism, or mediated by recombination-like events through &#x201c;inter-molecular&#x201d; mechanisms is immaterial. The end result is a reassortment of the molecules into all possible combinations.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0231">Optionally, the method comprises the additional step of screening the library members of the shuffled pool to identify individual shuffled library members having the ability to bind or otherwise interact (e.g., such as catalytic antibodies) with a predetermined macromolecule, such as for example a proteinaceous receptor, peptide oligosaccharide, viron, or other predetermined compound or structure.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0232">The displayed polypeptides, antibodies, peptidomimetic antibodies, and variable region sequences that are identified from such libraries can be used for therapeutic, diagnostic, research and related purposes (e.g., catalysts, solutes for increasing osmolarity of an aqueous solution, and the like), and/or can be subjected to one or more additional cycles of shuffling and/or affinity selection. The method can be modified such that the step of selecting for a phenotypic characteristic can be other than of binding affinity for a predetermined molecule (e.g., for catalytic activity, stability oxidation resistance, drug resistance, or detectable phenotype conferred upon a host cell).</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0233">The present invention provides a method for generating libraries of displayed antibodies suitable for affinity interactions screening. The method comprises (1) obtaining first a plurality of selected library members comprising a displayed antibody and an associated polynucleotide encoding said displayed antibody, and obtaining said associated polynucleotide encoding for said displayed antibody and obtaining said associated polynucleotides or copies thereof, wherein said associated polynucleotides comprise a region of substantially identical variable region framework sequence, and (2) introducing said polynucleotides into a suitable host cell and growing the cells under conditions which promote recombination and reductive reassortment resulting in shuffled polynucleotides. CDR combinations comprised by the shuffled pool are not present in the first plurality of selected library members, said shuffled pool composing a library of displayed antibodies comprising CDR permutations and suitable for affinity interaction screening. Optionally, the shuffled pool is subjected to affinity screening to select shuffled library members which bind to a predetermined epitope (antigen) and thereby selecting a plurality of selected shuffled library members. Further, the plurality of selectively shuffled library members can be shuffled and screened iteratively, from 1 to about 1000 cycles or as desired until library members having a desired binding affinity are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0234">In another aspect of the invention, it is envisioned that prior to or during recombination or reassortment, polynucleotides generated by the method of the present invention can be subjected to agents or processes which promote the introduction of mutations into the original polynucleotides. The introduction of such mutations would increase the diversity of resulting hybrid polynucleotides and polypeptides encoded therefrom. The agents or processes which promote mutagenesis can include, but are not limited to: (+)-CC-1065, or a synthetic analog such as (+)-CC-1065-(N3-Adenine, see Sun and Hurley, 1992); an N-acelylated or deacetylated 4&#x2032;-fluro-4-aminobiphenyl adduct capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis (see, for example, van de Poll et al, 1992); or a N-acetylated or deacetylated 4-aminobiphenyl adduct capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis (see also, van de Poll et al, 1992, pp. 751-758); trivalent chromium, a trivalent chromium salt, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (&#x201c;PAH&#x201d;) DNA adduct capable of inhibiting DNA replication, such as 7-bromomethyl-benz[a]anthracene (&#x201c;BMA&#x201d;), tris(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate (&#x201c;Tris-BP&#x201d;), 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (&#x201c;DBCP&#x201d;), 2-bromoacrolein (2BA), benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9-10-epoxide (&#x201c;BPDE&#x201d;), a platinum(II) halogen salt, N-hydroxy-2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]-quinoline (&#x201c;N-hydroxy-IQ&#x201d;), and N-hydroxy-2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-f]-pyridine (&#x201c;N-hydroxy-PhIP&#x201d;). Especially preferred &#x201c;means for slowing or halting PCR amplification consist of UV light (+)-CC-1065 and (+)-CC-1065-(N3-Adenine). Particularly encompassed means are DNA adducts or polynucleotides comprising the DNA adducts from the polynucleotides or polynucleotides pool, which can be released or removed by a process including heating the solution comprising the polynucleotides prior to further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0235">In another aspect the present invention is directed to a method of producing recombinant proteins having biological activity by treating a sample comprising double-stranded template polynucleotides encoding a wild-type protein under conditions according to the present invention which provide for the production of hybrid or re-assorted polynucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0236">The invention also provides the use of polynucleotide shuffling to shuffle a population of viral genes (e.g., capsid proteins, spike glycoproteins, polymerases, and proteases) or viral genomes (e.g., paramyxoviridae, orthomyxoviridae, herpesviruses, retroviruses, reoviruses and rhinoviruses). In an embodiment, the invention provides a method for shuffling sequences encoding all or portions of immunogenic viral proteins to generate novel combinations of epitopes as well as novel epitopes created by recombination; such shuffled viral proteins may comprise epitopes or combinations of epitopes as well as novel epitopes created by recombination; such shuffled viral proteins may comprise epitopes or combinations of epitopes which are likely to arise in the natural environment as a consequence of viral evolution; (e.g., such as recombination of influenza virus strains).</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0237">The invention also provides a method suitable for shuffling polynucleotide sequences for generating gene therapy vectors and replication-defective gene therapy constructs, such as may be used for human gene therapy, including but not limited to vaccination vectors for DNA-based vaccination, as well as anti-neoplastic gene therapy and other general therapy formats.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0238">In the polypeptide notation used herein, the left-hand direction is the amino terminal direction and the right-hand direction is the carboxy-terminal direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention. Similarly, unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5&#x2032; end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5&#x2032; direction. The direction of 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5&#x2032; to the 5&#x2032; end of the RNA transcript are referred to as &#x201c;upstream sequences&#x201d;; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3&#x2032; to the 3&#x2032; end of the coding RNA transcript are referred to as &#x201c;downstream sequences&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Methodology</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0239">Nucleic acid shuffling is a method for in vitro or in vivo homologous recombination of pools of shorter or smaller polynucleotides to produce a polynucleotide or polynucleotides. Mixtures of related nucleic acid sequences or polynucleotides are subjected to sexual PCR to provide random polynucleotides, and reassembled to yield a library or mixed population of recombinant hybrid nucleic acid molecules or polynucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0240">In contrast to cassette mutagenesis, only shuffling and error-prone PCR allow one to mutate a pool of sequences blindly (without sequence information other than primers).</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0241">The advantage of the mutagenic shuffling of this invention over error-prone PCR alone for repeated selection can best be explained with an example from antibody engineering. Consider DNA shuffling as compared with error-prone PCR (not sexual PCR). The initial library of selected pooled sequences can consist of related sequences of diverse origin (i.e. antibodies from naive mRNA) or can be derived by any type of mutagenesis (including shuffling) of a single antibody gene. A collection of selected complementarity determining regions (&#x201c;CDRs&#x201d;) is obtained after the first round of affinity selection. <?delete-start id="REI-00022"  date="20150120" ?>In the diagram the thick<?delete-end id="REI-00022" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00023"  date="20150120" ?>The <?insert-end id="REI-00023" ?>CDRs confer onto the antibody molecule increased affinity for the antigen. Shuffling allows the free combinatorial association of all of the CDR1s with all of the CDR2s with all of the CDR3s, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0242">This method differs from error-prone PCR, in that it is an inverse chain reaction. In error-prone PCR, the number of polymerase start sites and the number of molecules grows exponentially. However, the sequence of the polymerase start sites and the sequence of the molecules remains essentially the same. In contrast, in nucleic acid reassembly or shuffling of random polynucleotides the number of start sites and the number (but not size) of the random polynucleotides decreases over time. For polynucleotides derived from whole plasmids the theoretical endpoint is a single, large concatemeric molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0243">Since cross-overs occur at regions of homology, recombination will primarily occur between members of the same sequence family. This discourages combinations of CDRs that are grossly incompatible (e.g., directed against different epitopes of the same antigen). It is contemplated that multiple families of sequences can be shuffled in the same reaction. Further, shuffling generally conserves the relative order, such that, for example, CDR1 will not be found in the position of CDR2.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0244">Rare shufflants will contain a large number of the best (eg. highest affinity) CDRs and these rare shufflants may be selected based on their superior affinity.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0245">CDRs from a pool of 100 different selected antibody sequences can be permutated in up to 100<sup>6 </sup>different ways. This large number of permutations cannot be represented in a single library of DNA sequences. Accordingly, it is contemplated that multiple cycles of DNA shuffling and selection may be required depending on the length of the sequence and the sequence diversity desired.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0246">Error-prone PCR, in contrast, keeps all the selected CDRs in the same relative sequence, generating a much smaller mutant cloud.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0247">The template polynucleotide which may be used in the methods of this invention may be DNA or RNA. It may be of various lengths depending on the size of the gene or shorter or smaller polynucleotide to be recombined or reassembled. Preferably, the template polynucleotide is from 50 by to 50 kb. It is contemplated that entire vectors containing the nucleic acid encoding the protein of interest can be used in the methods of this invention, and in fact have been successfully used.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0248">The template polynucleotide may be obtained by amplification using the PCR reaction (U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195) or other amplification or cloning methods. However, the removal of free primers from the PCR products before subjecting them to pooling of the PCR products and sexual PCR may provide more efficient results. Failure to adequately remove the primers from the original pool before sexual PCR can lead to a low frequency of crossover clones.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0249">The template polynucleotide often should be double-stranded. A double-stranded nucleic acid molecule is recommended to ensure that regions of the resulting single-stranded polynucleotides are complementary to each other and thus can hybridize to form a double-stranded molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0250">It is contemplated that single-stranded or double-stranded nucleic acid polynucleotides having regions of identity to the template polynucleotide and regions of heterology to the template polynucleotide may be added to the template polynucleotide, at this step. It is also contemplated that two different but related polynucleotide templates can be mixed at this step.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0251">The double-stranded polynucleotide template and any added double- or single-stranded polynucleotides are subjected to sexual PCR which includes slowing or halting to provide a mixture of from about 5 bp to 5 kb or more. Preferably the size of the random polynucleotides is from about 10 bp to 1000 bp, more preferably the size of the polynucleotides is from about 20 bp to 500 bp.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0252">Alternatively, it is also contemplated that double-stranded nucleic acid having multiple nicks may be used in the methods of this invention. A nick is a break in one strand of the double-stranded nucleic acid. The distance between such nicks is preferably 5 bp to 5 kb, more preferably between 10 bp to 1000 bp. This can provide areas of self-priming to produce shorter or smaller polynucleotides to be included with the polynucleotides resulting from random primers, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0253">The concentration of any one specific polynucleotide will not be greater than 1% by weight of the total polynucleotides, more preferably the concentration of any one specific nucleic acid sequence will not be greater than 0.1% by weight of the total nucleic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0254">The number of different specific polynucleotides in the mixture will be at least about 100, preferably at least about 500, and more preferably at least about 1000.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0255">At this step single-stranded or double-stranded polynucleotides, either synthetic or natural, may be added to the random double-stranded shorter or smaller polynucleotides in order to increase the heterogeneity of the mixture of polynucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0256">It is also contemplated that populations of double-stranded randomly broken polynucleotides may be mixed or combined at this step with the polynucleotides from the sexual PCR process and optionally subjected to one or more additional sexual PCR cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0257">Where insertion of mutations into the template polynucleotide is desired, single-stranded or double-stranded polynucleotides having a region of identity to the template polynucleotide and a region of heterology to the template polynucleotide may be added in a 20 fold excess by weight as compared to the total nucleic acid, more preferably the single-stranded polynucleotides may be added in a 10 fold excess by weight as compared to the total nucleic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0258">Where a mixture of different but related template polynucleotides is desired, populations of polynucleotides from each of the templates may be combined at a ratio of less than about 1:100, more preferably the ratio is less than about 1:40. For example, a backcross of the wild-type polynucleotide with a population of mutated polynucleotide may be desired to eliminate neutral mutations (e.g., mutations yielding an insubstantial alteration in the phenotypic property being selected for). In such an example, the ratio of randomly provided wild-type polynucleotides which may be added to the randomly provided sexual PCR cycle hybrid polynucleotides is approximately 1:1 to about 100:1, and more preferably from 1:1 to 40:1.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0259">The mixed population of random polynucleotides are denatured to form single-stranded polynucleotides and then re-annealed. Only those single-stranded polynucleotides having regions of homology with other single-stranded polynucleotides will re-anneal.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0260">The random polynucleotides may be denatured by heating. One skilled in the art could determine the conditions necessary to completely denature the double-stranded nucleic acid. Preferably the temperature is from 80&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C., more preferably the temperature is from 90&#xb0; C. to 96&#xb0; C. other methods which may be used to denature the polynucleotides include pressure (36) and pH.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0261">The polynucleotides may be re-annealed by cooling. Preferably the temperature is from 20&#xb0; C. to 75&#xb0; C., more preferably the temperature is from 40&#xb0; C. to 65&#xb0; C. If a high frequency of crossovers is needed based on an average of only 4 consecutive bases of homology, recombination can be forced by using a low annealing temperature, although the process becomes more difficult. The degree of renaturation which occurs will depend on the degree of homology between the population of single-stranded polynucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0262">Renaturation can be accelerated by the addition of polyethylene glycol (&#x201c;PEG&#x201d;) or salt. The salt concentration is preferably from 0 mM to 200 mM, more preferably the salt concentration is from 10 mM to 100 mm. The salt may be KCl or NaCl. The concentration of PEG is preferably from 0% to 20%, more preferably from 5% to 10%.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0263">The annealed polynucleotides are next incubated in the presence of a nucleic acid polymerase and dNTP's (i.e. dATP, dCTP, DGTP and dTTP). The nucleic acid polymerase may be the Klenow fragment, the Taq polymerase or any other DNA polymerase known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0264">The approach to be used for the assembly depends on the minimum degree of homology that should still yield cross-overs. If the areas of identity are large, Taq polymerase can be used with an annealing temperature of between 45-65&#xb0; C. If the areas of identity are small, Klenow polymerase can be used with an annealing temperature of between 20-30&#xb0; C. One skilled in the art could vary the temperature of annealing to increase the number of cross-overs achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0265">The polymerase may be added to the random polynucleotides prior to annealing, simultaneously with annealing or after annealing.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0266">The cycle of denaturation, renaturation and incubation in the presence of polymerase is referred to herein as shuffling or reassembly of the nucleic acid. This cycle is repeated for a desired number of times. Preferably the cycle is repeated from 2 to 50 times, more preferably the sequence is repeated from 10 to 40 times.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0267">The resulting nucleic acid is a larger double-stranded polynucleotide of from about 50 bp to about 100 kb, preferably the larger polynucleotide is from 500 bp to 50 kb.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0268">This larger polynucleotide may contain a number of copies of a polynucleotide having the same size as the template polynucleotide in tandem. This concatemeric polynucleotide is then denatured into single copies of the template polynucleotide. The result will be a population of polynucleotides of approximately the same size as the template polynucleotide. The population will be a mixed population where single or double-stranded polynucleotides having an area of identity and an area of heterology have been added to the template polynucleotide prior to shuffling.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0269">These polynucleotides are then cloned into the appropriate vector and the ligation mixture used to transform bacteria.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0270">It is contemplated that the single polynucleotides may be obtained from the larger concatemeric polynucleotide by amplification of the single polynucleotide prior to cloning by a variety of methods including PCR (U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202), rather than by digestion of the concatemer.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0271">The vector used for cloning is not critical provided that it will accept a polynucleotide of the desired size. If expression of the particular polynucleotide is desired, the cloning vehicle should further comprise transcription and translation signals next to the site of insertion of the polynucleotide to allow expression of the polynucleotide in the host cell. Preferred vectors include the pUC series and the pBR series of plasmids.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0272">The resulting bacterial population will include a number of recombinant polynucleotides having random mutations. This mixed population may be tested to identify the desired recombinant polynucleotides. The method of selection will depend on the polynucleotide desired.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0273">For example, if a polynucleotide which encodes a protein with increased binding efficiency to a ligand is desired, the proteins expressed by each of the portions of the polynucleotides in the population or library may be tested for their ability to bind to the ligand by methods known in the art (i.e. panning, affinity chromatography). If a polynucleotide which encodes for a protein with increased drug resistance is desired, the proteins expressed by each of the polynucleotides in the population or library may be tested for their ability to confer drug resistance to the host organism. One skilled in the art, given knowledge of the desired protein, could readily test the population to identify polynucleotides which confer the desired properties onto the protein.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0274">It is contemplated that one skilled in the art could use a phage display system in which fragments of the protein are expressed as fusion proteins on the phage surface (Pharmacia, Milwaukee Wis.). The recombinant DNA molecules are cloned into the phage DNA at a site which results in the transcription of a fusion protein a portion of which is encoded by the recombinant DNA molecule. The phage containing the recombinant nucleic acid molecule undergoes replication and transcription in the cell. The leader sequence of the fusion protein directs the transport of the fusion protein to the tip of the phage particle. Thus the fusion protein which is partially encoded by the recombinant DNA molecule is displayed on the phage particle for detection and selection by the methods described above.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0275">It is further contemplated that a number of cycles of nucleic acid shuffling may be conducted with polynucleotides from a sub-population of the first population, which sub-population contains DNA encoding the desired recombinant protein. In this manner, proteins with even higher binding affinities or enzymatic activity could be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0276">It is also contemplated that a number of cycles of nucleic acid shuffling may be conducted with a mixture of wild-type polynucleotides and a sub-population of nucleic acid from the first or subsequent rounds of nucleic acid shuffling in order to remove any silent mutations from the sub-population.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0277">Any source of nucleic acid, in purified form can be utilized as the starting nucleic acid. Thus the process may employ DNA or RNA including messenger RNA, which DNA or RNA may be single or double stranded. In addition, a DNA-RNA hybrid which contains one strand of each may be utilized. The nucleic acid sequence may be of various lengths depending on the size of the nucleic acid sequence to be mutated. Preferably the specific nucleic acid sequence is from 50 to 50000 base pairs. It is contemplated that entire vectors containing the nucleic acid encoding the protein of interest may be used in the methods of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0278">The nucleic acid may be obtained from any source, for example, from plasmids such a pBR322, from cloned DNA or RNA or from natural DNA or RNA from any source including bacteria, yeast, viruses and higher organisms such as plants or animals. DNA or RNA may be extracted from blood or tissue material. The template polynucleotide may be obtained by amplification using the polynucleotide chain reaction (PCR, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195). Alternatively, the polynucleotide may be present in a vector present in a cell and sufficient nucleic acid may be obtained by culturing the cell and extracting the nucleic acid from the cell by methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0279">Any specific nucleic acid sequence can be used to produce the population of hybrids by the present process. It is only necessary that a small population of hybrid sequences of the specific nucleic acid sequence exist or be created prior to the present process.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0280">The initial small population of the specific nucleic acid sequences having mutations may be created by a number of different methods. Mutations may be created by error-prone PCR. Error-prone PCR uses low-fidelity polymerization conditions to introduce a low level of point mutations randomly over a long sequence. Alternatively, mutations can be introduced into the template polynucleotide by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. In oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, a short sequence of the polynucleotide is removed from the polynucleotide using restriction enzyme digestion and is replaced with a synthetic polynucleotide in which various bases have been altered from the original sequence. The polynucleotide sequence can also be altered by chemical mutagenesis. Chemical mutagens include, for example, sodium bisulfite, nitrous acid, hydroxylamine, hydrazine or formic acid. other agents which are analogues of nucleotide precursors include nitrosoguanidine, 5-bromouracil, 2-aminopurine, or acridine. Generally, these agents are added to the PCR reaction in place of the nucleotide precursor thereby mutating the sequence. Intercalating agents such as proflavine, acriflavine, quinacrine and the like can also be used. Random mutagenesis of the polynucleotide sequence can also be achieved by irradiation with X-rays or ultraviolet light. Generally, plasmid polynucleotides so mutagenized are introduced into E. coli and propagated as a pool or library of hybrid plasmids.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0281">Alternatively the small mixed population of specific nucleic acids may be found in nature in that they may consist of different alleles of the same gene or the same gene from different related species (i.e., cognate genes). Alternatively, they may be related DNA sequences found within one species, for example, the immunoglobulin genes.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0282">Once the mixed population of the specific nucleic acid sequences is generated, the polynucleotides can be used directly or inserted into an appropriate cloning vector, using techniques well-known <?delete-start id="REI-00024"  date="20150120" ?>in,the<?delete-end id="REI-00024" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00025"  date="20150120" ?>in the <?insert-end id="REI-00025" ?>art.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0283">The choice of vector depends on the size of the polynucleotide sequence and the host cell to be employed in the methods of this invention. The templates of this invention may be plasmids, phages, cosmids, phagemids, viruses (e.g., retroviruses, parainfluenzavirus, herpesviruses, reoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and the like), or selected portions thereof (e.g., coat protein, spike glycoprotein, capsid protein). For example, cosmids and phagemids are preferred where the specific nucleic acid sequence to be mutated is larger because these vectors are able to stably propagate large polynucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0284">If the mixed population of the specific nucleic acid sequence is cloned into a vector it can be clonally amplified by inserting each vector into a host cell and allowing the host cell to amplify the vector. This is referred to as clonal amplification because while the absolute number of nucleic acid sequences increases, the number of hybrids does not increase. Utility can be readily determined by screening expressed polypeptides.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0285">The DNA shuffling method of this invention can be performed blindly on a pool of unknown sequences. By adding to the reassembly mixture oligonucleotides (with ends that are homologous to the sequences being reassembled) any sequence mixture can be incorporated at any specific position into another sequence mixture. Thus, it is contemplated that mixtures of synthetic oligonucleotides, PCR polynucleotides or even whole genes can be mixed into another <?delete-start id="REI-00026"  date="20150120" ?>sequence. library<?delete-end id="REI-00026" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00027"  date="20150120" ?>sequence library <?insert-end id="REI-00027" ?>at defined positions. The insertion of one sequence (mixture) is independent from the insertion of a sequence in another part of the template. Thus, the degree of recombination, the homology required, and the diversity of the library can be independently and simultaneously varied along the length of the reassembled DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0286">This approach of mixing two genes may be useful for the humanization of antibodies from murine hybridomas. The approach of mixing two genes or inserting alternative sequences into genes may be useful for any therapeutically used protein, for example, interleukin I, antibodies, tPA and growth hormone. The approach may also be useful in any nucleic acid for example, promoters or introns or 31 untranslated region or 51 untranslated regions of genes to increase expression or alter specificity of expression of proteins. The approach may also be used to mutate ribozymes or aptamers.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0287">Shuffling requires the presence of homologous regions separating regions of diversity. Scaffold-like protein structures may be particularly suitable for shuffling. The conserved scaffold determines the overall folding by self-association, while displaying relatively unrestricted loops that mediate the specific binding. Examples of such scaffolds are the immunoglobulin beta-barrel, and the four-helix bundle which are well-known in the art. This shuffling can be used to create scaffold-like proteins with various combinations of mutated sequences for binding.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Saturation Mutagenesis</heading>
<p id="p-0261" num="0288">In one aspect, this invention provides for the use of proprietary codon primers (containing a degenerate N,N,G/T sequence) to introduce point mutations into a polynucleotide, so as to generate a set of progeny polypeptides in which a full range of single amino acid substitutions is represented at each amino acid position. The oligos used are comprised contiguously of a first homologous sequence, a degenerate N,N,G/T sequence, and preferably but not necessarily a second homologous sequence. The downstream progeny translational products from the use of such oligos include all possible amino acid changes at each amino acid site along the polypeptide, because the degeneracy of the N,N,G/T sequence includes codons for all 20 amino acids.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0289">In one aspect, one such degenerate oligo (comprised of one degenerate N,N,G/T cassette) is used for subjecting each original codon in a parental polynucleotide template to a full range of codon substitutions. In another aspect, at least two degenerate N,N,G/T cassettes are used&#x2014;either in the same oligo or not, for subjecting at least two original codons in a parental polynucleotide template to a full range of codon substitutions. Thus, more than one N,N,G/T sequence can be contained in one oligo to introduce amino acid mutations at more than one site. This plurality of N,N,G/T sequences can be directly contiguous, or separated by one or more additional nucleotide sequence(s). In another aspect, oligos serviceable for introducing additions and deletions can be used either alone or in combination with the codons containing an N,N,G/T sequence, to introduce any combination or permutation of amino acid additions, deletions, and/or substitutions.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0290">In a particular exemplification, it is possible to simultaneously mutagenize two or more contiguous amino acid Positions using an oligo that contains contiguous N,N,G/T triplets, i.e. a degenerate (N,N,G/T)N sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0291">In another aspect, the present invention provides for the use of degenerate cassettes having less degeneracy than the N,N,G/T sequence. For example, it may be desirable in some instances to use (e.g. in an oligo) a degenerate triplet sequence comprised of only one N, where said N can be in the first second or third position of the triplet. Any other bases including any combinations and permutations thereof can be used in the remaining two positions of the triplet. Alternatively, it may be desirable in some instances to use (e.g. in an oligo) a degenerate N,N,N triplet sequence, or an N,N, G/C triplet sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0292">It is appreciated, however, that the use of a degenerate triplet (such as N,N,G/T or an N,N, G/C triplet sequence) as disclosed in the instant invention is advantageous for several reasons. In one aspect, this invention provides a means to systematically and fairly easily generate the substitution of the full range of possible amino acids (for a total of 20 amino acids) into each and every amino acid position in a polypeptide. Thus, for a 100 amino acid polypeptide, the instant invention provides a way to systematically and fairly easily generate 2000 distinct species (i.e. 20 possible amino acids per position&#xd7;100 amino acid positions). It is appreciated that there is provided, through the use of an oligo containing a degenerate N,N,G/T or an N,N, G/C triplet sequence, 32 individual sequences that code for 20 possible amino acids. Thus, in a reaction vessel in which a parental polynucleotide sequence is subjected to saturation mutagenesis using one such oligo, there are generated 32 distinct progeny polynucleotides encoding 20 distinct polypeptides. In contrast, the use of a non-degenerate oligo in site-directed mutagenesis leads to only one progeny polypeptide product per reaction vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0293">This invention also provides for the use of nondegenerate oligos, which can optionally be used in combination with degenerate primers disclosed. It is appreciated that in some situations, it is advantageous to use nondegenerate oligos to generate specific point mutations in a working polynucleotide. This provides a means to generate specific silent point mutations, point mutations leading to corresponding amino acid changes, and point mutations that cause the generation of stop codons and the corresponding expression of polypeptide fragments.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0294">Thus, in a preferred embodiment of this invention, each saturation mutagenesis reaction vessel contains polynucleotides encoding at least 20 progeny polypeptide molecules such that all 20 amino acids are represented at the one specific amino acid position corresponding to the codon position mutagenized in the parental polynucleotide. The 32-fold degenerate progeny polypeptides generated from each saturation mutagenesis reaction vessel can be subjected to clonal amplification (e.g. cloned into a suitable E. Coli host using an expression vector) and subjected to expression screening. When an individual progeny polypeptide is identified by screening to display a favorable change in property (when compared to the parental polypeptide), it can be sequenced to identify the correspondingly favorable amino acid substitution contained therein.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0295">It is appreciated that upon mutagenizing each and every amino acid position in a parental polypeptide using saturation mutagenesis as disclosed herein, favorable amino acid changes may be identified at more than one amino acid position. One or more new progeny molecules can be generated that contain a combination of all or part of these favorable amino acid substitutions. For example, if 2 specific favorable amino acid changes are identified in each of 3 amino acid positions in a polypeptide, the permutations include 3 possibilities at each position (no change from the original amino acid, and each of two favorable changes) and 3 positions. Thus, there are 3&#xd7;3&#xd7;3 or 27 total possibilities, including 7 that were previously examined &#x2014;6 single point mutations (i.e. 2 at each of three positions) and no change at any position.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0296">In yet another aspect, site-saturation mutagenesis can be used together with shuffling, chimerization, recombination and other mutagenizing processes, along with screening. This invention provides for the use of any mutagenizing process(es), including saturation mutagenesis, in an iterative manner. In one exemplification, the iterative use of any mutagenizing process(es) is used in combination with screening.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0297">Thus, in a non-limiting exemplification, this invention provides for the use of saturation mutagenesis in combination with additional mutagenization processes, such as a process where two or more related polynucleotides are introduced into a suitable host cell such that a hybrid polynucleotide is generated by recombination and reductive reassortment.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0298">In addition to performing mutagenesis along the entire sequence of a gene, the instant invention provides that mutagenesis can be use to replace each of any number of bases in a polynucleotide sequence, wherein the number of bases to be mutagenized is preferably every integer from 15 to 100,000. Thus, instead of mutagenizing every position along a molecule, one can subject every a discrete number of bases (preferably a subset totaling from 15 to 100,000) to mutagenesis. Preferably, a separate nucleotide is used for mutagenizing each position or group of positions along a polynucleotide sequence. A group of 3 positions to be mutagenized may be a codon. The mutations are preferably introduced using a mutagenic primer, containing a heterologous cassette, also referred to as a mutagenic cassette. Preferred cassettes can have from 1 to 500 bases. Each nucleotide position in such heterologous cassettes be N, A, C, G, T, A/C, NG, A/T, C/G, G/T, C/G/T, A/G/T, A/C/T, A/C/G, or E, where E is any base that is not A, C, G, or T (E can be referred to as a designer oligo). The tables below show exemplary tri-nucleotide cassettes (there are over 3000 possibilities in addition to N,N,G/T and N,N,N and N,N,A/C).</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0299">In a general sense, saturation mutagenesis is comprised of mutagenizing a complete set of mutagenic cassettes (wherein each cassette is preferably 1-500 bases in length) in defined polynucleotide sequence to be mutagenized (wherein the sequence to be mutagenized is preferably from 15 to 100,000 bases in length). Thusly, a group of mutations (ranging from 1 to 100 mutations) is introduced into each cassette to be mutagenized. A grouping of mutations to be introduced into one cassette can be different or the same from a second grouping of mutations to be introduced into a second cassette during the application of one round of saturation mutagenesis. Such groupings are exemplified by deletions, additions, groupings of particular codons, and groupings of particular nucleotide cassettes.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0300">Defined sequences to be mutagenized (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) include preferably a whole gene, pathway, cDNA, an entire open reading frame (ORF), and intire promoter, enhancer, repressor/transactivator, origin of replication, intron, operator, or any polynucleotide functional group. Generally, a preferred &#x201c;defined sequences&#x201d; for this purpose may be any polynucleotide that a 15 base-polynucleotide sequence, and polynucleotide sequences of lengths between 15 bases and 15,000 bases (this invention specifically names every integer in between). Considerations in choosing groupings of codons include types of amino acids encoded by a degenerate mutagenic cassette.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0301">In a particularly preferred exemplification a grouping of mutations that can be introduced into a mutagenic cassette, this invention specifically provides for degenerate codon substitutions (using degenerate oligos) that code for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 amino acids at each position, and a library of polypeptides encoded thereby.</p>

<p id="h-0012" num="0000">In vitro Shuffling</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0302">The equivalents of some standard genetic matings may also be performed by shuffling in vitro. For example, a &#x201c;molecular backcross&#x201d; can be performed by repeatedly mixing the hybrid's nucleic acid with the wild-type nucleic acid while selecting for the mutations of interest. As in traditional breeding, this approach can be used to combine phenotypes from different sources into a background of choice. It is useful, for example, for the removal of neutral mutations that affect unselected characteristics (i.e. immunogenicity). Thus it can be useful to determine which mutations in a protein are involved in the enhanced biological activity and which are not, an advantage which cannot be achieved by error-prone mutagenesis or cassette mutagenesis methods.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0303">Large, functional genes can be assembled correctly from a mixture of small random polynucleotides. This reaction may be of use for the reassembly of genes from the highly fragmented DNA of fossils. In addition random nucleic acid fragments from fossils may be combined with polynucleotides from similar genes from related species.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0304">It is also contemplated that the method of this invention can be used for the in vitro amplification of a whole genome from a single cell as is needed for a variety of research and diagnostic applications. DNA amplification by PCR is in practice limited to a length of about 40 kb. Amplification of a whole genome such as that of E. coli (5,000 kb) by PCR would require about 250 primers yielding 125 forty kb polynucleotides. This approach is not practical due to the unavailability of sufficient sequence data. On the other hand, random production of polynucleotides of the genome with sexual PCR cycles, followed by gel purification of small polynucleotides will provide a multitude of possible primers. Use of this mix of random small polynucleotides as primers in a PCR reaction alone or with the whole genome as the template should result in an inverse chain reaction with the theoretical endpoint of a single concatamer containing many copies of the genome.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0305">100 fold amplification in the copy number and an average polynucleotide size of greater than 50 kb may be obtained when only random polynucleotides are used. It is thought that the larger concatamer is generated by overlap of many smaller polynucleotides. The quality of specific PCR products obtained using synthetic primers will be indistinguishable from the product obtained from unamplified DNA. It is expected that this approach will be useful for the mapping of genomes.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0306">The polynucleotide to be shuffled can be produced as random or non-random polynucleotides, at the discretion of the practitioner. Moreover, this invention provides a method of shuffling that is applicable to a wide range of polynucleotide sizes and types, including the step of generating polynucleotide monomers to be used as building blocks in the reassembly of a larger polynucleotide. For example, the building blocks can be fragments of genes or they can be comprised of entire genes or gene pathways, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Exonuclease-mediated Shuffling</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0307">In a particular embodiment, this invention provides for a method for shuffling, assembling, reassembling, recombining, &#x26;/or concatenating at least two polynucleotides to form a progeny polynucleotide (e.g. a chimeric progeny polynucleotide that can be expressed to produce a polypeptide or a gene pathway). In a particular embodiment, a double stranded polynucleotide end (e.g. two single stranded sequences hybridized to each other as hybridization partners) is treated with an exonuclease to liberate nucleotides from one of the two strands, leaving the remaining strand free of its original partner so that, if desired, the remaining strand may be used to achieve hybridization to another partner.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0308">In a particular aspect, a double stranded polynucleotide end (that may be part of&#x2014;or connected to&#x2014;a polynucleotide or a nonpolynucleotide sequence) is subjected to a source of exonuclease activity. Serviceable sources of exonuclease activity may be an enzyme with 3&#x2032; exonuclease activity, an enzyme with 5&#x2032; exonuclease activity, an enzyme with both 3&#x2032; exonuclease activity and 5&#x2032; exonuclease activity, and any combination thereof. An exonuclease can be used to liberate nucleotides from one or both ends of a linear double stranded polynucleotide, and from one to all ends of a branched polynucleotide having more than two ends. The mechanism of action of this liberation is believed to be comprised of an enzymatically-catalyzed hydrolysis of terminal nucleotides, and can be allowed to proceed in a time-dependent fashion, allowing experimental control of the progression of the enzymatic process.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0309">By contrast, a non-enzymatic step may be used to shuffle, assemble, reassemble, recombine, and/or concatenate polynucleotide building blocks that is comprised of subjecting a working sample to denaturing (or &#x201c;melting&#x201d;) conditions (for example, by changing temperature, pH, and /or salinity conditions) so as to melt a working set of double stranded polynucleotides into single polynucleotide strands. For shuffling, it is desirable that the single polynucleotide strands participate to some extent in annealment with different hybridization partners (i.e. and not merely revert to exclusive reannealment between what were former partners before the denaturation step). The presence of the former hybridization partners in the reaction vessel, however, does not preclude, and may sometimes even favor, reannealment of a single stranded polynucleotide with its former partner, to recreate an original double stranded polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0310">In contrast to this non-enzymatic shuffling step comprised of subjecting double stranded polynucleotide building blocks to denaturation, followed by annealment, the instant invention further provides an exonuclease-based approach requiring no denaturation&#x2014;rather, the avoidance of denaturing conditions and the maintenance of double stranded polynucleotide substrates in annealed (i.e. non-denatured) state are necessary conditions for the action of exonucleases (e.g., exonuclease III and red alpha gene product). Additionally in contrast, the generation of single stranded polynucleotide sequences capable of hybridizing to other single stranded polynucleotide sequences is the result of covalent cleavage&#x2014;and hence sequence destruction&#x2014;in one of the hybridization partners. For example, an exonuclease III enzyme may be used to enzymatically liberate 3&#x2032; terminal nucleotides in one hybridization strand (to achieve covalent hydrolysis in that polynucleotide strand); and this favors hybridization of the remaining single strand to a new partner (since its former partner was subjected to covalent cleavage).</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0311">By way of further illustration, a specific exonuclease, namely exonuclease III is provided herein as an example of a 3&#x2032; exonuclease; however, other exonucleases may also be used, including enzymes with 5&#x2032; exonuclease activity and enzymes with 3&#x2032; exonuclease activity, and including enzymes not yet discovered and enzymes not yet developed. It is particularly appreciated that enzymes can be discovered, optimized (e.g. engineered by directed evolution), or both discovered and optimized specifically for the instantly disclosed approach that have more optimal rates &#x26;/or more highly specific activities &#x26;/or greater lack of unwanted activities. In fact it is expected that the instant invention may encourage the discovery &#x26;/or development of such designer enzymes. In sum, this invention may be practiced with a variety of currently available exonuclease enzymes, as well as enzymes not yet discovered and enzymes not yet developed.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0312">The exonuclease action of exonuclease III requires a working double stranded polynucleotide end that is either blunt or has a 5&#x2032; overhang, and the exonuclease action is comprised of enzymatically liberating 3&#x2032; terminal nucleotides, leaving a single stranded 5&#x2032; end that becomes longer and longer as the exonuclease action proceeds (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Any 5&#x2032; overhangs produced by this approach may be used to hybridize to another single stranded polynucleotide sequence (which may also be a single stranded polynucleotide or a terminal overhang of a partially double stranded polynucleotide) that shares enough homology to allow hybridization. The ability of these exonuclease III-generated single stranded sequences (e.g. in 5&#x2032; overhangs) to hybridize to other single stranded sequences allows two or more polynucleotides to be shuffled, assembled, reassembled, &#x26;/or concatenated.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0313">Furthermore, it is appreciated that one can protect the end of a double stranded polynucleotide or render it susceptible to a desired enzymatic action of a serviceable exonuclease as necessary. For example, a double stranded polynucleotide end having a 3&#x2032; overhang is not susceptible to the exonuclease action of exonuclease III. However, it may be rendered susceptible to the exonuclease action of exonuclease III by a variety of means; for example, it may be blunted by treatment with a polymerase, cleaved to provide a blunt end or a 5&#x2032; overhang, joined (ligated or hybridized) to another double stranded polynucleotide to provide a blunt end or a 5&#x2032; overhang, hybridized to a single stranded polynucleotide to provide a blunt end or a 5&#x2032; overhang, or modified by any of a variety of means).</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0314">According to one aspect, an exonuclease may be allowed to act on one or on both ends of a linear double stranded polynucleotide and proceed to completion, to near completion, or to partial completion. When the exonuclease action is allowed to go to completion, the result will be that the length of each 5&#x2032; overhang will be extended far towards the middle region of the polynucleotide in the direction of what might be considered a &#x201c;rendezvous point&#x201d; (which may be somewhere near the polynucleotide midpoint). Ultimately, this results in the production of single stranded polynucleotides (that can become dissociated) that are each about half the length of the original double stranded polynucleotide (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Alternatively, an exonuclease-mediated reaction can be terminated before proceeding to completion.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0315">Thus this exonuclease-mediated approach is serviceable for shuffling, assembling &#x26;/or reassembling, recombining, and concatenating polynucleotide building blocks, which polynucleotide building blocks can be up to ten bases long or tens of bases long or hundreds of bases long or thousands of bases long or tens of thousands of bases long or hundreds of thousands of bases long or millions of bases long or even longer.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0316">This exonuclease-mediated approach is based on the action of double stranded DNA specific exodeoxyribonuclease activity of E. coli exonuclease III. Substrates for exonuclease III may be generated by subjecting a double stranded polynucleotide to fragmentation. Fragmentation may be achieved by mechanical means (e.g., shearing, sonication, etc.), by enzymatic means (e.g. using restriction enzymes), and by any combination thereof. Fragments of a larger polynucleotide may also be generated by polymerase-mediated synthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0317">Exonuclease III is a 28K monomeric enzyme, product of the xthA gene of E. Coli with four known activities: exodeoxyribonuclease (alternatively referred to as exonuclease herein), RNaseH, DNA-3&#x2032;-phosphatase, and AP endonuclease. The exodeoxyribonuclease activity is specific for double stranded DNA. The mechanism of action is thought to involve enzymatic hydrolysis of DNA from a 3&#x2032; end progressively towards a 5&#x2032; direction, with formation of nucleoside 5&#x2032;-phosphates and a residual single strand. The enzyme does not display efficient hydrolysis of single stranded DNA, single-stranded RNA, or double-stranded RNA; however it degrades RNA in an DNA-RNA hybrid releasing nucleoside 5&#x2032;-phosphates. The enzyme also releases inorganic phosphate specifically from 3&#x2032;phosphomonoester groups on DNA, but not from RNA or short oligonucleotides. Removal of these groups converts the terminus into a primer for DNA polymerase action.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0318">Additional examples of enzymes with exonuclease activity include red-alpha and venom phosphodiesterases. Red alpha (red&#x3b1;) gene product (also referred to as lambda exonuclease) is of bacteriophage &#x3bb; origin. The reds gene is transcribed from the leftward promoter and its product is involved (24 kD) in recombination. Red alpha gene product acts processively from 5&#x2032;-phosphorylated termini to liberate mononucleotides from duplex DNA (Takahashi &#x26; Kobayashi, 1990). Venom phosphodiesterases (Laskowski, 1980) is capable of rapidly opening supercoiled DNA.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Synthetic Ligation Reassembly</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0319">In one aspect, the present invention provides a non-stochastic method termed synthetic ligation reassembly (SLR), that is somewhat related to stochastic shuffling, save that the nucleic acid building blocks are not shuffled or concatenated or chimerized randomly, but rather are assembled non-stochastically.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0320">A particularly glaring difference is that the instant SLR method does not depend on the presence of a high level of homology between polynucleotides to be shuffled. In contrast, prior methods, particularly prior stochastic shuffling methods require that presence of a high level of homology, particularly at coupling sites, between polynucleotides to be shuffled. Accordingly these prior methods favor the regeneration of the original progenitor molecules, and are suboptimal for generating, large numbers of novel progeny chimeras, particularly full-length progenies. The instant invention, on the other hand, can be used to non-stochastically generate libraries (or sets) of progeny molecules comprised of over 10<sup>100 </sup>different chimeras. Conceivably, SLR can even be used to generate libraries comprised of over 10<sup>1000 </sup>different progeny chimeras with (no upper limit in sight).</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0321">Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides a method, which method is non-stochastic, of producing a set of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules having an overall assembly order that is chosen by design, which method is comprised of the steps of generating by design a plurality of specific nucleic acid building blocks having serviceable mutually compatible ligatable ends, and assembling these nucleic acid building blocks, such that a designed overall assembly order is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0322">The mutually compatible ligatable ends of the nucleic acid building blocks to be assembled are considered to be &#x201c;serviceable&#x201d; for this type of ordered assembly if they enable the building blocks to be coupled in predetermined orders. Thus, in one aspect, the overall assembly order in which the nucleic acid building blocks can be coupled is specified by the design of the ligatable ends and, if more than one assembly step is to be used, then the overall assembly order in which the nucleic acid building blocks can be coupled is also specified by the sequential order of the assembly step(s). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, Panel C illustrates an exemplary assembly process comprised of 2 sequential steps to achieve a designed (non-stochastic) overall assembly order for five nucleic acid building blocks. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the annealed building pieces are treated with an enzyme, such as a ligase (e.g. T4 DNA ligase), achieve covalent bonding of the building pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0323">In a preferred embodiment, the design of nucleic acid building blocks is obtained upon analysis of the sequences of a set of progenitor nucleic acid templates that serve as a basis for producing a progeny set of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules. These progenitor nucleic acid templates thus serve as a source of sequence information that aids in the design of the nucleic acid building blocks that are to be mutagenized; i.e. chimerized or shuffled.</p>

<p id="p-0298" num="0404">These exemplifications, while illustrating certain specific aspects of the invention, do not portray the limitations or circumscribe the scope of the disclosed invention.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0405">Thus according to one aspect of this invention, the sequences of a plurality of progenitor nucleic acid templates are aligned in order to select one or more demarcation points, which demarcation points can be located at an area of homology, and are comprised of one or more nucleotides, and which demarcation points are shared by at least two of the progenitor templates. The demarcation points can be used to delineate the boundaries of nucleic acid building blocks to be generated. Thus, the demarcation points identified and selected in the progenitor molecules serve as potential chimerization points in the assembly of the progeny molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0406">Preferably a serviceable demarcation point is an area of homology (comprised of at least one homologous nucleotide base) shared by at least two progenitor templates. More preferably a serviceable demarcation point is an area of homology that is shared by at least half of the progenitor templates. More preferably still a serviceable demarcation point is an area of homology that is shared by at least two thirds of the progenitor templates. Even more preferably a serviceable demarcation points is an area of homology that is shared by at least three fourths of the progenitor templates. Even more preferably still a serviceable demarcation points is an area of homology that is shared by at almost all of the progenitor templates. Even more preferably still a serviceable demarcation point is an area of homology that is shared by all of the progenitor templates.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0407">The process of designing nucleic acid building blocks and of designing the mutually compatible ligatable ends of the nucleic acid building blocks to be assembled is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. As shown, the alignment of a set of progenitor templates reveals several naturally occurring demarcation points, and the identification of demarcation points shared by these templates helps to non-stochastically determine the building blocks to be generated and used for the generation of the progeny chimeric molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0408">In a preferred embodiment, this invention provides that the ligation reassembly process is performed exhaustively in order to generate an exhaustive library. In other words, all possible ordered combinations of the nucleic acid building blocks are represented in the set of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules. At the same time, in a particularly preferred embodiment, the assembly order (i.e. the order of assembly of each building block in the 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; sequence of each finalized chimeric nucleic acid) in each combination is by design (or non-stochastic). Because of the non-stochastic nature of this invention, the possibility of unwanted side products is greatly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0409">In another preferred embodiment, this invention provides that, the ligation reassembly process is performed systematically, for example in order to generate a systematically compartmentalized library, with compartments that can be screened systematically, e.g. one by one. In other words this invention provides that, through the selective and judicious use of specific nucleic acid building blocks, coupled with the selective and judicious use of sequentially stepped assembly reactions, an experimental design can be achieved where specific sets of progeny products are made in each of several reaction vessels. This allows a systematic examination and screening procedure to be performed. Thus, it allows a potentially very large number of progeny molecules to be examined systematically in smaller groups.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0410">Because of its ability to perform chimerizations in a manner that is highly flexible yet exhaustive and systematic as well, particularly when there is a low level of homology among the progenitor molecules, the instant invention provides for the generation of a library (or set) comprised of a large number of progeny molecules. Because of the non-stochastic nature of the instant ligation reassembly invention, the progeny molecules generated preferably comprise a library of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules having an overall assembly order that is chosen by design. In a particularly preferred embodiment of this invention, such a generated library is comprised of preferably greater than 10<sup>3 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably greater than 10<sup>5 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>10 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>15 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>20 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>30 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>40 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>50 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>60 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>70 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>80 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>100 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>110 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>120 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>130 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>140 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>150 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>175 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>200 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>300 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>400 </sup>different progeny molecular species, more preferably still greater than 10<sup>500 </sup>different progeny molecular species, and even more preferably still greater than 10<sup>1000 </sup>different progeny molecular species.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0411">In one aspect, a set of finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecules, produced as described is comprised of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide. According to one preferred embodiment, this polynucleotide is a gene, which may be a man-made gene. According to another preferred embodiment, this polynucleotide is a gene pathway, which may be a man-made gene pathway. This invention provides that one or more man-made genes generated by this invention may be incorporated into a man-made gene pathway, such as pathway operable in a eukaryotic organism (including a plant).</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0412">It is appreciated that the power of this invention is exceptional, as there is much freedom of choice and control regarding the selection of demarcation points, the size and number of the nucleic acid building blocks, and the size and design of the couplings. It is appreciated, furthermore, that the requirement for intermolecular homology is highly relaxed for the operability of this invention. In fact, demarcation points can even be chosen in areas of little or no intermolecular homology. For example, because of codon wobble, i.e. the degeneracy of codons, nucleotide substitutions can be introduced into nucleic acid building blocks without altering the amino acid originally encoded in the corresponding progenitor template. Alternatively, a codon can be altered such that the coding for an originally amino acid is altered. This invention provides that such substitutions can be introduced into the nucleic acid building block in order to increase the incidence of intermolecularly homologous demarcation points and thus to allow an increased number of couplings to be achieved among the building blocks, which in turn allows a greater number of progeny chimeric molecules to be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0413">In another exemplification, the synthetic nature of the step in which the building blocks are generated allows the design and introduction of nucleotides (e.g. one or more nucleotides, which may be, for example, codons or introns or regulatory sequences) that can later be optionally removed in an in vitro process (e.g. by <?delete-start id="REI-00028"  date="20150120" ?>mutageneis<?delete-end id="REI-00028" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00029"  date="20150120" ?>mutagenesis<?insert-end id="REI-00029" ?>) or in an in vivo process (e.g. by utilizing the gene splicing ability of a host organism). It is appreciated that in many instances the introduction of these nucleotides may also be desirable for many other reasons in addition to the potential benefit of creating a serviceable demarcation point.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0414">Thus, according to another embodiment, this invention provides that a nucleic acid building block can be used to introduce an intron. Thus, this invention provides that functional introns may be introduced into a man-made gene of this invention. This invention also provides that functional introns may be introduced into a man-made gene pathway of this invention. Accordingly, this invention provides for the generation of a chimeric polynucleotide that is a man-made gene containing one (or more) artificially introduced intron(s).</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0415">Accordingly, this invention also provides for the generation of a chimeric polynucleotide that is a man-made gene pathway containing one (or more) artificially introduced intron(s). Preferably, the artificially introduced intron(s) are functional in one or more host cells for gene splicing much in the way that naturally-occurring introns serve functionally in gene splicing. This invention provides a process of producing man-made intron-containing polynucleotides to be introduced into host organisms for recombination and/or splicing.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0416">The ability to achieve chimerizations, using couplings as described herein, in areas of little or no homology among the progenitor molecules, is particularly useful, and in fact critical, for the assembly of novel gene pathways. This invention thus provides for the generation of novel man-made gene pathways using synthetic ligation reassembly. In a particular aspect, this is achieved by the introduction of regulatory sequences, such as promoters, that are operable in an intended host, to confer operability to a novel gene pathway when it is introduced into the intended host. In a particular exemplification, this invention provides for the generation of novel man-made gene pathways that is operable in a plurality of intended hosts (e.g. in a microbial organism as well as in a plant cell). This can be achieve, for example, by the introduction of a plurality of regulatory sequences, comprised of a regulatory sequence that is operable in a first intended host and a regulatory sequence that is operable in a second intended host. A similar process can be performed to achieve operability of a gene pathway in a third intended host species, etc. The number of intended host species can be each integer from 1 to 10 or alternatively over 10. Alternatively, for example, operability of a gene pathway in a plurality of intended hosts can be achieved by the introduction of a regulatory sequence having intrinsic operability in a plurality of intended hosts.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0417">Thus, according to a particular embodiment, this invention provides that a nucleic acid building block can be used to introduce a regulatory sequence, particularly a regulatory sequence for gene expression. Preferred regulatory sequences include, but are not limited to, those that are man-made, and those found in archeal, bacterial, eukaryotic (including mitochondrial), viral, and prionic or prion-like organisms. Preferred regulatory sequences include but are not limited to, promoters, operators, and activator binding sites. Thus, this invention provides that functional regulatory sequences may be introduced into a man-made gene of this invention. This invention also provides that functional regulatory sequences may be introduced into a man-made gene pathway of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0418">Accordingly, this invention provides for the generation of a chimeric polynucleotide that is a man-made gene containing one (or more) artificially introduced regulatory sequence(s). Accordingly, this invention also provides for the generation of a chimeric polynucleotide that is a man-made gene pathway containing one (or more) artificially introduced regulatory sequence(s). Preferably, an artificially introduced regulatory sequence(s) is operatively linked to one or more genes in the man-made polynucleotide, and are functional in one or more host cells.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0419">Preferred bacterial promoters that are serviceable for this invention include lacI, lacZ, T3, T7, gpt, lambda P<sub>R</sub>, P<sub>L </sub>and trp. Serviceable eukaryotic promoters include CMV immediate early, HSV thymidine kinase, early and late SV40, LTRs from retrovirus, and mouse metallothionein-I. Particular plant regulatory sequences include promoters active in directing transcription in plants, either constitutively or stage and/or tissue specific, depending on the use of the plant or parts thereof. These promoters include, but are not limited to promoters showing constitutive expression, such as the 35S promoter of Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) (Guilley et al., 1982), those for leaf-specific expression, such as the promoter of the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit gene (Coruzzi et al., 1984), those for root-specific expression, such as the promoter from the glutamin synthase gene (Tingey et al., 1987), those for seed-specific expression, such as the cruciferin A promoter from Brassica napus (Ryan et al., 1989), those for tuber-specific expression, such as the class-I patatin promoter from potato (Rocha-Sasa et al., 1989; Wenzler et al., 1989) or those for fruit-specific expression, such as the polygalacturonase (PG) promoter from tomato (Bird et al., 1988).</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0420">Other regulatory sequences that are preferred for this invention include terminator sequences and polyadenylation signals and any such sequence functioning as such in plants, the choice of which is within the level of the skilled artisan. An example of such sequences is the 3&#x2032; flanking region of the nopaline synthase (nos) gene of Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Bevan, 1984). The regulatory sequences may also include enhancer sequences, such as found in the 35S promoter of CaMV, and mRNA stabilizing sequences such as the leader sequence of Alfalfa Mosaic Cirus (A1MV) RNA4 (Brederode et al., 1980) or any other sequences functioning in a like manner.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0421">A man-made genes produced using this invention can also serve as a substrate for recombination with another nucleic acid. Likewise, a man-made gene pathway produced using this invention can also serve as a substrate for recombination with another nucleic acid. In a preferred instance, the recombination is facilitated by, or occurs at, areas of homology between the man-made intron-containing gene and a nucleic acid with serves as a recombination partner. In a particularly preferred instance, the recombination partner may also be a nucleic acid generated by this invention, including a man-made gene or a man-made gene pathway. Recombination may be facilitated by or may occur at areas of homology that exist at the one (or more) artificially introduced intron(s) in the man-made gene.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0422">The synthetic ligation reassembly method of this invention utilizes a plurality of nucleic acid building blocks, each of which preferably has two ligat able ends. The two ligatable ends on each nucleic acid building block may be two blunt ends (i.e. each having an overhang of zero nucleotides), or preferably one blunt end and one overhang, or more preferably still two overhangs.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0423">A serviceable overhang for this purpose may be a 3&#x2032; overhang or a 5&#x2032; overhang. Thus, a nucleic acid building block may have a 3&#x2032; overhang or alternatively a 5&#x2032; overhang or alternatively two 3&#x2032; overhangs or alternatively two 5&#x2032; overhangs. The overall order in which the nucleic acid building blocks are assembled to form a finalized chimeric nucleic acid molecule is determined by purposeful experimental design and is not random.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0424">According to one preferred embodiment, a nucleic acid building block is generated by chemical synthesis of two single-stranded nucleic acids (also referred to as single-stranded oligos) and contacting them so as to allow them to anneal to form a double-stranded nucleic acid building block.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0425">A double-stranded nucleic acid building block can be of variable size. The sizes of these building blocks can be small or large depending on the choice of the experimenter. Preferred sizes for building block range from 1 base pair (not including any overhangs) to 100,000 base pairs (not including any overhangs). Other preferred size ranges are also provided, which have lower limits of from 1 bp to 10,000 bp (including every integer value in between), and upper limits of from 2 bp to 100, 000 bp (including every integer value in between).</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0426">It is appreciated that current methods of polymerase-based amplification can be used to generate double-stranded nucleic acids of up to thousands of base pairs, if not tens of thousands of base pairs, in length with high fidelity. Chemical synthesis (e.g. phosphoramidite-based) can be used to generate nucleic acids of up to hundreds of nucleotides in length with high fidelity; however, these can be assembled, e.g. using overhangs or sticky ends, to form double-stranded nucleic acids of up to thousands of base pairs, if not tens of thousands of base pairs, in length if so desired.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0427">A combination of methods (e.g. phosphoramidite-based chemical synthesis and PCR) can also be used according to this invention. Thus, nucleic acid building block made by different methods can also be used in combination to generate a progeny molecule of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0428">The use of chemical synthesis to generate nucleic acid building blocks is particularly preferred in this invention &#x26; is advantageous for other reasons as well, including procedural safety and ease. No cloning or harvesting or actual handling of any biological samples is required. The design of the nucleic acid building blocks can be accomplished on paper. Accordingly, this invention teaches an advance in procedural safety in recombinant technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0429">Nonetheless, according to one preferred embodiment, a double-stranded nucleic acid building block according to this invention may also be generated by polymerase-based amplification of a polynucleotide template. In a non-limiting exemplification, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a first polymerase-based amplification reaction using a first set of primers, F<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>1</sub>, is used to generate a blunt-ended product (labeled Reaction 1, Product 1), which is essentially identical to Product A. A second polymerase-based amplification reaction using a second set of primers, F<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2</sub>, is used to generate a blunt-ended product (labeled Reaction 2, Product 2), which is essentially identical to Product B. These two products are mixed and allowed to melt and anneal, generating potentially useful double-stranded nucleic acid building blocks with two overhangs. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the product with the 3&#x2032; overhangs (Product C) is selected by nuclease-based degradation of the other 3 products using a 3&#x2032; acting exonuclease, such as exonuclease III. It is appreciated that a 5&#x2032; acting exonuclease (e.g. red alpha) may be also be used, for example to select Product D instead. It is also appreciated that other selection means can also be used, including hybridization-based means, and that these means can incorporate a further means, such as a magnetic bead-based means, to facilitate separation of the desired product.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0430">Many other methods exist by which a double-stranded nucleic acid building block can be generated that is serviceable for this invention; and these are known in the art and can be readily performed by the skilled artisan.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0431">According to particularly preferred embodiment, a double-stranded nucleic acid building block that is serviceable for this invention is generated by first generating two single stranded nucleic acids and allowing them to anneal to form a double-stranded nucleic acid building block. The two strands of a double-stranded nucleic acid building block may be complementary at every nucleotide apart from any that form an overhang; thus containing no mismatches, apart from any overhang(s). According to another embodiment, the two strands of a double-stranded nucleic acid building block are complementary at fewer than every nucleotide apart from any that form an overhang. Thus, according to this embodiment, a double-stranded nucleic acid building block can be used to introduce codon degeneracy. Preferably the codon degeneracy is introduced using the site-saturation mutagenesis described herein, using one or more N,N,G/T cassettes or alternatively using one or more N,N,N cassettes.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0432">Contained within an exemplary experimental design for achieving an ordered assembly according to this invention are:

<p id="p-0327" num="0436">An overhang may be a 3&#x2032; overhang or a 5&#x2032; overhang. An overhang may also have a terminal phosphate group or alternatively may be devoid of a terminal phosphate group (having, e.g., a hydroxyl group instead). An overhang may be comprised of any number of nucleotides. Preferably an overhang is comprised of 0 nucleotides (as in a blunt end) to 10,000 nucleotides. Thus, a wide range of overhang sizes may be serviceable. Accordingly, the lower limit may be each integer from 1-200 and the upper limit may be each integer from 2-10,000. According to a particular exemplification, an overhang may consist of anywhere from 1 nucleotide to 200 nucleotides (including every integer value in between).</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0437">The final chimeric nucleic acid molecule may be generated by sequentially assembling 2 or more building blocks at a time until all the designated building blocks have been assembled. A working sample may optionally be subjected to a process for size selection or purification or other selection or enrichment process between the performance of two assembly steps. Alternatively, the final chimeric nucleic acid molecule may be generated by assembling all the designated building blocks at once in one step.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0438">The methods of these experiments allow reassembly to occur among nucleic acids having a little or no homology. Additionally fusion points or couplings can also occur in regions of low or no homology. The number of resulting molecules that can be generated in according to this experiment is very large.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0439">Rather than to physically generate and screen this large number of potential products in random order, it is appreciated that, optionally with the aid of a computer, groupings of these potential products can be non-stochastically determined and furthermore ranked according to the predicted the likelihood that desirable products are contained in each grouping. Accordingly it is appreciated according to this experiment that computer modeling (&#x201c;in silico&#x201d;) or mental calculations or considerations (&#x201c;in cranio&#x201d;) may be useful to determine groupings all of potential reassembly products, where each such grouping is delineated by the potential products that can be generated using one set (or a finite set) of reagents and/or resulting from a one application (or a finite number of applications) of a method (or a finite as number of methods) disclosed herein. Additionally the groupings can be ranked against each other mentally or using computer modeling by predicting the number of potentially desirable or usable products in each grouping.</p>

<p id="h-0015" num="0000">In vivo Shuffling</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0442">In an embodiment of in vivo shuffling, the mixed population of the specific nucleic acid sequence is introduced into bacterial or eukaryotic cells under conditions such that at least two different nucleic acid sequences are present in each host cell. The polynucleotides can be introduced into the host cells by a variety of different methods. The host cells can be transformed with the smaller polynucleotides using methods known in the art, for example treatment with calcium chloride. If the polynucleotides are inserted into a phage genome, the host cell can be transfected with the recombinant phage genome having the specific nucleic acid sequences. Alternatively, the nucleic acid sequences can be introduced into the host cell using electroporation, transfection, lipofection, biolistics, conjugation, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0443">In general, in this embodiment, the specific nucleic acids sequences will be present in vectors which are capable of stably replicating the sequence in the host cell. In addition, it is contemplated that the vectors will encode a marker gene such that host cells having the vector can be selected. This ensures that the mutated specific nucleic acid sequence can be recovered after introduction into the host cell. However, it is contemplated that the entire mixed population of the specific nucleic acid sequences need not be present on a vector sequence. Rather only a sufficient number of sequences need be cloned into vectors to ensure that after introduction of the polynucleotides into the host cells each host cell contains one vector having at least one specific nucleic acid sequence present therein. It is also contemplated that rather than having a subset of the population of the specific nucleic acids sequences cloned into vectors, this subset may be already stably integrated into the host cell.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0444">It has been found that when two polynucleotides which have regions of identity are inserted into the host cells homologous recombination occurs between the two polynucleotides. Such recombination between the two mutated specific nucleic acid sequences will result in the production of double or triple hybrids in some situations.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0445">It has also been found that the frequency of recombination is increased if some of the mutated specific nucleic acid sequences are present on linear nucleic acid molecules. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, some of the specific nucleic acid sequences are present on linear polynucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0446">After transformation, the host cell transformants are placed under selection to identify those host cell transformants which contain mutated specific nucleic acid sequences having the qualities desired. For example, if increased resistance to a particular drug is desired then the transformed host cells may be subjected to increased concentrations of the particular drug and those transformants producing mutated proteins able to confer increased drug resistance will be selected. If the enhanced ability of a particular protein to bind to a receptor is desired, then expression of the protein can be induced from the transformants and the resulting protein assayed in a ligand binding assay by methods known in the art to identify that subset of the mutated population which shows enhanced binding to the ligand. Alternatively, the protein can be expressed in another system to ensure proper processing.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0447">Once a subset of the first recombined specific nucleic acid sequences (daughter sequences) having the desired characteristics are identified, they are then subject to a second round of recombination.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0448">In the second cycle of recombination, the recombined specific nucleic acid sequences may be mixed with the original mutated specific nucleic acid sequences (parent sequences) and the cycle repeated as described above. In this way a set of second recombined specific nucleic acids sequences can be identified which have enhanced characteristics or encode for proteins having enhanced properties. This cycle can be repeated a number of times as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0449">It is also contemplated that in the second or subsequent recombination cycle, a backcross can be performed. A molecular backcross can be performed by mixing the desired specific nucleic acid sequences with a large number of the wild-type sequence, such that at least one wild-type nucleic acid sequence and a mutated nucleic acid sequence are present in the same host cell after transformation. Recombination with the wild-type specific nucleic acid sequence will eliminate those neutral mutations that may affect unselected characteristics such as immunogenicity but not the selected characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0450">In another embodiment of this invention, it is contemplated that during the first round a subset of the specific nucleic acid sequences can be generated as smaller polynucleotides by slowing or halting their PCR amplification prior to introduction into the host cell. The size of the polynucleotides must be large enough to contain some regions of identity with the other sequences so as to homologously recombine with the other sequences. The size of the polynucleotides will range from 0.03 kb to 100 kb more preferably from 0.2 kb to 10 kb. It is also contemplated that in subsequent rounds, all of the specific nucleic acid sequences other than the sequences selected from the previous round may be utilized to generate PCR polynucleotides prior to introduction into the host cells.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0451">The shorter polynucleotide sequences can be single-stranded or double-stranded. If the sequences were originally single-stranded and have become double-stranded they can be denatured with heat, chemicals or enzymes prior to insertion into the host cell. The reaction conditions suitable for separating the strands of nucleic acid are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0452">The steps of this process can be repeated indefinitely, being limited only by the number of possible hybrids which can be achieved. After a certain number of cycles, all possible hybrids will have been achieved and further cycles are redundant.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0453">In an embodiment the same mutated template nucleic acid is repeatedly recombined and the resulting recombinants selected for the desired characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0454">Therefore, the initial pool or population of mutated template nucleic acid is cloned into a vector capable of replicating in a bacteria such as E. coli. The particular vector is not essential, so long as it is capable of autonomous replication in E. coli. In a preferred embodiment, the vector is designed to allow the expression and production of any protein encoded by the mutated specific nucleic acid linked to the vector. It is also preferred that the vector contain a gene encoding for a selectable marker.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0455">The population of vectors containing the pool of mutated nucleic acid sequences is introduced into the E. coli host cells. The vector nucleic acid sequences may be introduced by transformation, transfection or infection in the case of phage. The concentration of vectors used to transform the bacteria is such that a number of vectors is introduced into each cell. Once present in the cell, the efficiency of homologous recombination is such that homologous recombination occurs between the various vectors. This results in the generation of hybrids (daughters) having a combination of mutations which differ from the original parent mutated sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0456">The host cells are then clonally replicated and selected for the marker gene present on the vector. Only those cells having a plasmid will grow under the selection.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0457">The host cells which contain a vector are then tested for the presence of favorable mutations. Such testing may consist of placing the cells under selective pressure, for example, if the gene to be selected is an improved drug resistance gene. If the vector allows expression of the protein encoded by the mutated nucleic acid sequence, then such selection may include allowing expression of the protein so encoded, isolation of the protein and testing of the protein to determine whether, for example, it binds with increased efficiency to the ligand of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0458">Once a particular daughter mutated nucleic acid sequence has been identified which confers the desired characteristics, the nucleic acid is isolated either already linked to the vector or separated from the vector. This nucleic acid is then mixed with the first or parent population of nucleic acids and the cycle is repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0459">It has been shown that by this method nucleic acid sequences having enhanced desired properties can be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0460">In an alternate embodiment, the first generation of hybrids are retained in the cells and the parental mutated sequences are added again to the cells. Accordingly, the first cycle of Embodiment I is conducted as described above. However, after the daughter nucleic acid sequences are identified, the host cells containing these sequences are retained.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0461">The parent mutated specific nucleic acid population, either as polynucleotides or cloned into the same vector is introduced into the host cells already containing the daughter nucleic acids. Recombination is allowed to occur in the cells and the next generation of recombinants, or granddaughters are selected by the methods described above.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0462">This cycle can be repeated a number of times until the nucleic acid or peptide having the desired characteristics is obtained. It is contemplated that in subsequent cycles, the population of mutated sequences which are added to the preferred hybrids may come from the parental hybrids or any subsequent generation.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0463">In an alternative embodiment, the invention provides a method of conducting a &#x201c;molecular&#x201d; backcross of the obtained recombinant specific nucleic acid in order to eliminate any neutral mutations. Neutral mutations are those mutations which do not confer onto the nucleic acid or peptide the desired properties. Such mutations may however confer on the nucleic acid or peptide undesirable characteristics. Accordingly, it is desirable to eliminate such neutral mutations. The method of this invention provide a means of doing so.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0464">In this embodiment, after the hybrid nucleic acid, having the desired characteristics, is obtained by the methods of the embodiments, the nucleic acid, the vector having the nucleic acid or the host cell containing the vector and nucleic acid is isolated.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0465">The nucleic acid or vector is then introduced into the host cell with a large excess of the wild-type nucleic acid. The nucleic acid of the hybrid and the nucleic acid of the wild-type sequence are allowed to recombine. The resulting recombinants are placed under the same selection as the hybrid nucleic acid. Only those recombinants which retained the desired characteristics will be selected. Any silent mutations which do not provide the desired characteristics will be lost through recombination with the wild-type DNA. This cycle can be repeated a number of times until all of the silent mutations are eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0466">Thus the methods of this invention can be used in a molecular backcross to eliminate unnecessary or silent mutations.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Utility</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0467">The in vivo recombination method of this invention can be performed blindly on a pool of unknown hybrids or alleles of a specific polynucleotide or sequence. However, it is not necessary to know the actual DNA or RNA sequence of the specific polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0468">The approach of using recombination within a mixed population of genes can be useful for the generation of any useful proteins, for example, interleukin I, antibodies, tPA and growth hormone. This approach may be used to generate proteins having altered specificity or activity. The approach may also be useful for the generation of hybrid nucleic acid sequences, for example, promoter regions, introns, exons, enhancer sequences, 31 untranslated regions or 51 untranslated regions of genes. Thus this approach may be used to generate genes having increased rates of expression. This approach may also be useful in the study of repetitive DNA sequences. Finally, this approach may be useful to mutate ribozymes or aptamers.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0469">Scaffold-like regions separating regions of diversity in proteins may be particularly suitable for the methods of this invention. The conserved scaffold determines the overall folding by self-association, while displaying relatively unrestricted loops that mediate the specific binding. Examples of such scaffolds are the immunoglobulin beta barrel, and the four-helix bundle. The methods of this invention can be used to create scaffold-like proteins with various combinations of mutated sequences for binding.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0470">The equivalents of some standard genetic matings may also be performed by the methods of this invention. For example, a &#x201c;molecular&#x201d; backcross can be performed by repeated mixing of the hybrid's nucleic acid with the wild-type nucleic acid while selecting for the mutations of interest. As in traditional breeding, this approach can be used to combine phenotypes from different sources into a background of choice. It is useful, for example, for the removal of neutral mutations that affect unselected characteristics (i.e. immunogenicity). Thus it can be useful to determine which mutations in a protein are involved in the enhanced biological activity and which are not.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Peptide Display Methods</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0471">The present method can be used to shuffle, by in vitro and/or in vivo recombination by any of the disclosed methods, and in any combination, polynucleotide sequences selected by peptide display methods, wherein an associated polynucleotide encodes a displayed peptide which is screened for a phenotype (e.g., for affinity for a predetermined receptor (ligand).</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0472">An increasingly important aspect of bio-pharmaceutical drug development and molecular biology is the identification of peptide structures, including the primary amino acid sequences, of peptides or peptidomimetics that interact with biological macromolecules. one method of identifying peptides that possess a desired structure or functional property, such as binding to a predetermined biological macromolecule (e.g., a receptor), involves the screening of a large library or peptides for individual library members which possess the desired structure or functional property conferred by the amino acid sequence of the peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0473">In addition to direct chemical synthesis methods for generating peptide libraries, several recombinant DNA methods also have been reported. One type involves the display of a peptide sequence, antibody, or other protein on the surface of a bacteriophage particle or cell. Generally, in these methods each bacteriophage particle or cell serves as an individual library member displaying a single species of displayed peptide in addition to the natural bacteriophage or cell protein sequences. Each bacteriophage or cell contains the nucleotide sequence information encoding the particular displayed peptide sequence; thus, the displayed peptide sequence can be ascertained by nucleotide sequence determination of an isolated library member.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0474">A well-known peptide display method involves the presentation of a peptide sequence on the surface of a filamentous bacteriophage, typically as a fusion with a bacteriophage coat protein. The bacteriophage library can be incubated with an immobilized, predetermined macromolecule or small molecule (e.g., a receptor) so that bacteriophage particles which present a peptide sequence that binds to the immobilized macromolecule can be differentially partitioned from those that do not present peptide sequences that bind to the predetermined macromolecule. The bacteriophage particles (i.e., library members) which are bound to the immobilized macromolecule are then recovered and replicated to amplify the selected bacteriophage sub-population for a subsequent round of affinity enrichment and phage replication. After several rounds of affinity enrichment and phage replication, the bacteriophage library members that are thus selected are isolated and the nucleotide sequence encoding the displayed peptide sequence is determined, thereby identifying the sequence(s) of peptides that bind to the predetermined macromolecule (e.g., receptor). Such methods are further described in PCT patent publications WO 91/17271, WO 91/18980, WO 91/19818 and WO 93108278.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0475">The latter PCT publication describes a recombinant DNA method for the display of peptide ligands that involves the production of a library of fusion proteins with each fusion protein composed of a first polypeptide portion, typically comprising a variable sequence, that is available for potential binding to a predetermined macromolecule, and a second polypeptide portion that binds to DNA, such as the DNA vector encoding the individual fusion protein. When transformed host cells are cultured under conditions that allow for expression of the fusion protein, the fusion protein binds to the DNA vector encoding it. Upon lysis of the host cell, the fusion protein/vector DNA complexes can be screened against a predetermined macromolecule in much the same way as bacteriophage particles are screened in the phage-based display system, with the replication and sequencing of the DNA vectors in the selected fusion protein/vector DNA complexes serving as the basis for identification of the selected library peptide sequence(s).</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0476">Other systems for generating libraries of peptides and like polymers have aspects of both the recombinant and in vitro chemical synthesis methods. In these hybrid methods, cell-free enzymatic machinery is employed to accomplish the in vitro synthesis of the library members (i.e., peptides or polynucleotides). In one type of method, RNA molecules with the ability to bind a predetermined protein or a predetermined dye molecule were selected by alternate rounds of selection and PCR amplification (Therk and Gold, 1990; Ellington and Szostak, 1990). A similar technique was used to identify DNA sequences which bind a predetermined human transcription factor (Thiesen and Bach, 1990; Beaudry and Joyce, 1992; PCT patent publications WO 92/05258 and WO 92/14843). In a similar fashion, the technique of in vitro translation has been used to synthesize proteins of interest and has been proposed as a method for generating large libraries of peptides. These methods which rely upon in vitro translation, generally comprising stabilized polysome complexes, are described further in PCT patent publications WO 88/08453, WO 90/05785, WO 90/07003, WO 91/02076, WO 91/05058, and WO 92/02536. Applicants have described methods in which library members comprise a fusion protein having a first polypeptide portion with DNA binding activity and a second polypeptide portion having the library member unique peptide sequence; such methods are suitable for use in cell-free in vitro selection formats, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0477">The displayed peptide sequences can be of varying lengths, typically from 3-5000 amino acids long or longer, frequently from 5-100 amino acids long, and often from about 8-15 amino acids long. A library can comprise library members having varying lengths of displayed peptide sequence, or may comprise library members having a fixed length of displayed peptide sequence. Portions or all of the displayed peptide sequence(s) can be random, pseudorandom, defined set kernal, fixed, or the like. The present display methods include methods for in vitro and in vivo display of single-chain antibodies, such as nascent scFv on polysomes or scfv displayed on phage, which enable large-scale screening of scfv libraries having broad diversity of variable region sequences and binding specificities.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0478">The present invention also provides random, pseudorandom, and defined sequence framework peptide libraries and methods for generating and screening those libraries to identify useful compounds (e.g., peptides, including single-chain antibodies) that bind to receptor molecules or epitopes of interest or gene products that modify peptides or RNA in a desired fashion. The random, pseudorandom, and defined sequence framework peptides are produced from libraries of peptide library members that comprise displayed peptides or displayed single-chain antibodies attached to a polynucleotide template from which the displayed peptide was synthesized. The mode of attachment may vary according to the specific embodiment of the invention selected, and can include encapsulation in a phage particle or incorporation in a cell.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0479">A method of affinity enrichment allows a very large library of peptides and single-chain antibodies to be screened and the polynucleotide sequence encoding the desired peptide(s) or single-chain antibodies to be selected. The polynucleotide can then be isolated and shuffled to recombine combinatorially the amino acid sequence of the selected peptide(s) (or predetermined portions thereof) or single-chain antibodies (or just VHI, VLI or CDR portions thereof). Using these methods, one can identify a peptide or single-chain antibody as having a desired binding affinity for a molecule and can exploit the process of shuffling to converge rapidly to a desired high-affinity peptide or scfv. The peptide or antibody can then be synthesized in bulk by conventional means for any suitable use (e.g., as a therapeutic or diagnostic agent).</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0480">A significant advantage of the present invention is that no prior information regarding an expected ligand structure is required to isolate peptide ligands or antibodies of interest. The peptide identified can have biological activity, which is meant to include at least specific binding affinity for a selected receptor molecule and, in some instances, will further include the ability to block the binding of other compounds, to stimulate or inhibit metabolic pathways, to act as a signal or messenger, to stimulate or inhibit cellular activity, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0481">The present invention also provides a method for shuffling a pool of polynucleotide sequences selected by affinity screening a library of polysomes displaying nascent peptides (including single-chain antibodies) for library members which bind to a predetermined receptor (e.g., a mammalian proteinaceous receptor such as, for example, a peptidergic hormone receptor, a cell surface receptor, an intracellular protein which binds to other protein(s) to form intracellular protein complexes such as hetero-dimers and the like) or epitope (e.g., an immobilized protein, glycoprotein, oligosaccharide, and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0482">Polynucleotide sequences selected in a first selection round (typically by affinity selection for binding to a receptor (e.g., a ligand)) by any of these methods are pooled and the pool(s) is/are shuffled by in vitro and/or in vivo recombination to produce a shuffled pool comprising a population of recombined selected polynucleotide sequences. The recombined selected polynucleotide sequences are subjected to at least one subsequent selection round. The polynucleotide sequences selected in the subsequent selection round(s) can be used directly, sequenced, and/or subjected to one or more additional rounds of shuffling and subsequent selection. Selected sequences can also be back-crossed with polynucleotide sequences encoding neutral sequences (i.e., having insubstantial functional effect on binding), such as for example by back-crossing with a wild-type or naturally-occurring sequence substantially identical to a selected sequence to produce native-like functional peptides, which may be less immunogenic. Generally, during back-crossing subsequent selection is applied to retain the property of binding to the predetermined receptor (ligand).</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0483">Prior to or concomitant with the shuffling of selected sequences, the sequences can be mutagenized. In one embodiment, selected library members are cloned in a prokaryotic vector (e.g., plasmid, phagemid, or bacteriophage) wherein a collection of individual colonies (or plaques) representing discrete library members are produced. Individual selected library members can then be manipulated (e.g., by site-directed mutagenesis, cassette mutagenesis, chemical mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and the like) to generate a collection of library members representing a kernal of sequence diversity based on the sequence of the selected library member. The sequence of an individual selected library member or pool can be manipulated to incorporate random mutation, pseudorandom mutation, defined kernal mutation (i.e., comprising variant and invariant residue positions and/or comprising variant residue positions which can comprise a residue selected from a defined subset of amino acid residues), codon-based mutation, and the like, either segmentally or over the entire length of the individual selected library member sequence. The mutagenized selected library members are then shuffled by in vitro and/or in vivo recombinatorial shuffling as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0484">The invention also provides peptide libraries comprising a plurality of individual library members of the invention, wherein (1) each individual library member of said plurality comprises a sequence produced by shuffling of a pool of selected sequences, and (2) each individual library member comprises a variable peptide segment sequence or single-chain antibody segment sequence which is distinct from the variable peptide segment sequences or single-chain antibody sequences of other individual library members in said plurality (although some library members may be present in more than one copy per library due to uneven amplification, stochastic probability, or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0485">The invention also provides a product-by-process, wherein selected polynucleotide sequences having (or encoding a peptide having) a predetermined binding specificity are formed by the process of: (1) screening a displayed peptide or displayed single-chain antibody library against a predetermined receptor (e.g., ligand) or epitope (e.g., antigen macromolecule) and identifying and/or enriching library members which bind to the predetermined receptor or epitope to produce a pool of selected library members, (2) shuffling by recombination the selected library members (or amplified or cloned copies thereof) which binds the predetermined epitope and has been thereby isolated and/or enriched from the library to generate a shuffled library, and (3) screening the shuffled library against the predetermined receptor (e.g., ligand) or epitope (e.g., antigen macromolecule) and identifying and/or enriching shuffled library members which bind to the predetermined receptor or epitope to produce a pool of selected shuffled library members.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Antibody Display and Screening Methods</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0486">The present method can be used to shuffle, by in vitro and/or in vivo recombination by any of the disclosed methods, and in any combination, polynucleotide sequences selected by antibody display methods, wherein an associated polynucleotide encodes a displayed antibody which is screened for a phenotype (e.g., for affinity for binding a predetermined antigen (ligand).</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0487">Various molecular genetic approaches have been devised to capture the vast immunological repertoire represented by the extremely large number of distinct variable regions which can be present in immunoglobulin chains. The naturally-occurring germ line immunoglobulin heavy chain locus is composed of separate tandem arrays of variable segment genes located upstream of a tandem array of diversity segment genes, which are themselves located upstream of a tandem array of joining (i) region genes, which are located upstream of the constant region genes. During B lymphocyte development, V-D-J rearrangement occurs wherein a heavy chain variable region gene (VH) is formed by rearrangement to form a fused D segment followed by rearrangement with a V segment to form a V-D-J joined product gene which, if productively rearranged, encodes a functional variable region (VH) of a heavy chain. Similarly, light chain loci rearrange one of several V segments with one of several J segments to form a gene encoding the variable region (VL) of a light chain.</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0488">The vast repertoire of variable regions possible in immunoglobulins derives in part from the numerous combinatorial possibilities of joining V and <?delete-start id="REI-00030"  date="20150120" ?>i<?delete-end id="REI-00030" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00031"  date="20150120" ?>J <?insert-end id="REI-00031" ?>segments (and, in the case of heavy chain loci, D segments) during rearrangement in B cell development. Additional sequence diversity in the heavy chain variable regions arises from non-uniform rearrangements of the D segments during V-D-J joining and from N region addition. Further, antigen-selection of specific B cell clones selects for higher affinity variants having non-<?delete-start id="REI-00032"  date="20150120" ?>germnline<?delete-end id="REI-00032" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00033"  date="20150120" ?>germline <?insert-end id="REI-00033" ?>mutations in one or both of the heavy and light chain variable regions; a phenomenon referred to as &#x201c;affinity maturation&#x201d; or &#x201c;affinity sharpening&#x201d;. Typically, these &#x201c;affinity sharpening&#x201d; mutations cluster in specific areas of the variable region, most commonly in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs).</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0489">In order to overcome many of the limitations in producing and identifying high-affinity immunoglobulins through antigen-stimulated B cell development (i.e., immunization), various prokaryotic expression systems have been developed that can be manipulated to produce combinatorial antibody libraries which may be screened for high-affinity antibodies to specific antigens. Recent advances in the expression of antibodies in Escherichia coli and bacteriophage systems (see &#x201c;alternative peptide display methods&#x201d;, infra) have raised the possibility that virtually any specificity can be obtained by either cloning antibody genes from characterized hybridomas or by de novo selection using antibody gene libraries (e.g., from Ig cDNA).</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0490">Combinatorial libraries of antibodies have been generated in bacteriophage lambda expression systems which may be screened as bacteriophage plaques or as colonies of lysogens (Huse et al, 1989); Caton and Koprowski, 1990; Mullinax et al, 1990; Persson et al, 1991). Various embodiments of bacteriophage antibody display libraries and lambda phage expression libraries have been described (Kang et al, 1991; Clackson et al, 1991; McCafferty et al, 1990; Burton et al, 1991; Hoogenboom et al, 1991; Chang et al, 1991; Breitling et al, 1991; Marks et al, 1991, p. 581; Barbas et al, 1992; Hawkins and Winter, 1992; Marks et al, 1992, p. 779; Marks et al, 1992, p. 16007; and Lowman et al, 1991; Lerner et al, 1992; all incorporated herein by reference). Typically, a bacteriophage antibody display library is screened with a receptor (e.g., polypeptide, carbohydrate, glycoprotein, nucleic acid) that is immobilized (e.g., by covalent linkage to a chromatography resin to enrich for reactive phage by affinity chromatography) and/or labeled (e.g., to screen plaque or colony lifts).</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0491">One particularly advantageous approach has been the use of so-called single-chain fragment variable (scfv) libraries (Marks et al, 1992, p. 779; Winter and Milstein, 1991; Clackson et al, 1991; Marks et al, 1991, p. 581; Chaudhary et al, 1990; Chiiswell et al, 1992; McCafferty et al, 1990; and Huston et al, 1988). Various embodiments of scfv libraries displayed on bacteriophage coat proteins have been described.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0492">Beginning in 1988, single-chain analogues of Fv fragments and their fusion proteins have been reliably generated by antibody engineering methods. The first step generally involves obtaining the genes encoding VH and VL domains with desired binding properties; these V genes may be isolated from a specific hybridoma cell line, selected from a combinatorial V-gene library, or made by V gene synthesis. The single-chain Fv is formed by connecting the component V genes with an oligonucleotide that encodes an appropriately designed linker peptide, such as (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser)3 <?insert-start id="REI-00034"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 26) <?insert-end id="REI-00034" ?>or equivalent linker peptide(s). The linker bridges the C-terminus of the first V region and N-terminus of the second, ordered as either VH-linker-VL or VL-linker-VH&#x2032; In principle, the scfv binding site can faithfully replicate both the affinity and specificity of its parent antibody combining site.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0493">Thus, scfv fragments are comprised of VH and VL domains linked into a single polypeptide chain by a flexible linker peptide. After the scfv genes are assembled, they are cloned into a phagemid and expressed at the tip of the M13 phage (or similar filamentous bacteriophage) as fusion proteins with the bacteriophage PIII (gene 3) coat protein. Enriching for phage expressing an antibody of interest is accomplished by panning the recombinant phage displaying a population scfv for binding to a predetermined epitope (e.g., target antigen, receptor).</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0494">The linked polynucleotide of a library member provides the basis for replication of the library member after a screening or selection procedure, and also provides the basis for the determination, by nucleotide sequencing, of the identity of the displayed peptide sequence or VH and VL amino acid sequence. The displayed peptide (s) or single-chain antibody (e.g., scfv) and/or its VH and VL domains or their CDRs can be cloned and expressed in a suitable expression system. Often polynucleotides encoding the isolated VH and VL domains will be ligated to polynucleotides encoding constant regions (CH and CL) to form polynucleotides encoding complete antibodies (e.g., chimeric or fully-human), antibody fragments, and the like. Often polynucleotides encoding the isolated CDRs will be grafted into polynucleotides encoding a suitable variable region framework (and optionally constant regions) to form polynucleotides encoding complete antibodies (e.g., humanized or fully-human), antibody fragments, and the like. Antibodies can be used to isolate preparative quantities of the antigen by immunoaffinity chromatography. Various other uses of such antibodies are to diagnose and/or stage disease (e.g., neoplasia) and for therapeutic application to treat disease, such as for example: neoplasia, autoimmune disease, AIDS, cardiovascular disease, infections, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0495">Various methods have been reported for increasing the combinatorial diversity of a scfv library to broaden the repertoire of binding species (idiotype spectrum) The use of PCR has permitted the variable regions to be rapidly cloned either from a specific hybridoma source or as a gene library from non-immunized cells, affording combinatorial diversity in the assortment of VH and VL cassettes which can be combined. Furthermore, the VH and VL cassettes can themselves be diversified, such as by random, pseudorandom, or directed mutagenesis. Typically, VH and VL cassettes are diversified in. or near the complementarity-determining regions (CDRS), often the third CDR, CDR3. Enzymatic inverse PCR mutagenesis has been shown to be a simple and reliable method for constructing relatively large libraries of scfv site-directed hybrids (Stemmer et al, 1993), as has error-prone PCR and chemical mutagenesis (Deng et al, 1994). Riechmann (Riechmann et al, 1993) showed semirational design of an antibody scfv fragment using site-directed randomization by degenerate oligonucleotide PCR and subsequent phage display of the resultant scfv hybrids. Barbas (Barbas et al, 1992) attempted to circumvent the problem of limited repertoire sizes resulting from using biased variable region sequences by randomizing the sequence in a synthetic CDR region of a human tetanus toxoid-binding Fab.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0496">CDR randomization has the potential to create approximately 1&#xd7;10<sup>20 </sup>CDRs for the heavy chain CDR3 alone, and a roughly similar number of variants of the heavy chain CDR1 and CDR2, and light chain CDR1-3 variants. Taken individually or together, the combination possibilities of CDR randomization of heavy and/or light chains requires generating a prohibitive number of bacteriophage clones to produce a clone library representing all possible combinations, the vast majority of which will be non-binding. Generation of such large numbers of primary transformants is not feasible with current transformation technology and bacteriophage display systems. For example, Barbas (Barbas et al, 1992) only generated 5&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>transformants, which represents only a tiny fraction of the potential diversity of a library of thoroughly randomized CDRS.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0497">Despite these substantial limitations, bacteriophage display of scfv have already yielded a variety of useful antibodies and antibody fusion proteins. A bispecific single chain antibody has been shown to mediate efficient tumor cell lysis (Gruber et al, 1994). Intracellular expression of an anti-Rev scfv has been shown to inhibit HIV-1 virus replication in vitro (Duan et al, 1994), and intracellular expression of an anti-p21rar, scfv has been shown to inhibit meiotic maturation of Xenopus oocytes (Biocca et al, 1993). Recombinant scfv which can be used to diagnose HIV infection have also been reported, demonstrating the diagnostic utility of scfv (Lilley et al, 1994). Fusion proteins wherein an scFv is linked to a second polypeptide, such as a toxin or fibrinolytic activator protein, have also been reported (Holvost et al, 1992; Nicholls et al, 1993).</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0498">If it were possible to generate scfv libraries having broader antibody diversity and overcoming many of the limitations of conventional CDR mutagenesis and randomization methods which can cover only a very tiny fraction of the potential sequence combinations, the number and quality of scfv antibodies suitable for therapeutic and diagnostic use could be vastly improved. To address this, the in vitro and in vivo shuffling methods of the invention are used to recombine CDRs which have been obtained (typically via PCR amplification or cloning) from nucleic acids obtained from selected displayed antibodies. Such displayed antibodies can be displayed on cells, on bacteriophage particles, on polysomes, or any suitable antibody display system wherein the antibody is associated with its encoding nucleic acid(s). In a variation, the CDRs are initially obtained from mRNA (or cDNA) from antibody-producing cells (e.g., plasma cells/splenocytes from an immunized wild-type mouse, a human, or a transgenic mouse capable of making a human antibody as in WO 92/03918, WO 93/12227, and WO 94/25585), including hybridomas derived therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0499">Polynucleotide sequences selected in a first selection round (typically by affinity selection for displayed antibody binding to an antigen (e.g., a ligand) by any of these methods are pooled and the pool(s) is/are shuffled by in vitro and/or in vivo recombination, especially shuffling of CDRs (typically shuffling heavy chain CDRs with other heavy chain CDRs and light chain CDRs with other light chain CDRs) to produce a shuffled pool comprising a population of recombined selected polynucleotide sequences. The recombined selected polynucleotide sequences are expressed in a selection format as a displayed antibody and subjected to at least one subsequent selection round. The polynucleotide sequences selected in the subsequent selection round(s) can be used directly, sequenced, and/or subjected to one or more additional rounds of shuffling and subsequent selection until an antibody of the desired binding affinity is obtained. Selected sequences can also be back-crossed with polynucleotide sequences encoding neutral antibody framework sequences (i.e., having insubstantial functional effect on antigen binding), such as for example by back-crossing with a human variable region framework to produce human-like sequence antibodies. Generally, during back-crossing subsequent selection is applied to retain the property of binding to the predetermined antigen.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0500">Alternatively, or in combination with the noted variations, the valency of the target epitope may be varied to control the average binding affinity of selected scfv library members. The target epitope can be bound to a surface or substrate at varying densities, such as by including a competitor epitope, by dilution, or by other method known to those in the art. A high density (valency) of predetermined epitope can be used to enrich for scfv library members which have relatively low affinity, whereas a low density (valency) can preferentially enrich for higher affinity scfv library members.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0501">For generating diverse variable segments, a collection of synthetic oligonucleotides encoding random, pseudorandom, or a defined sequence kernal set of peptide sequences can be inserted by ligation into a predetermined site (e.g., a CDR). Similarly, the sequence diversity of one or more CDRs of the single-chain antibody cassette(s) can be expanded by mutating the CDR(s) with site-directed mutagenesis, CDR-replacement, and the like. The resultant DNA molecules can be propagated in a host for cloning and amplification prior to shuffling, or can be used directly (i.e., may avoid loss of diversity which may occur upon propagation in a host cell) and the selected library members subsequently shuffled.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0502">Displayed peptide/polynucleotide complexes (library members) which encode a variable segment peptide sequence of interest or a single-chain antibody of interest are selected from the library by an affinity enrichment technique. This is accomplished by means of a immobilized macromolecule or epitope specific for the peptide sequence of interest, such as a receptor, other macromolecule, or other epitope species. Repeating the affinity selection procedure provides an enrichment of library members encoding the desired sequences, which may then be isolated for pooling and shuffling, for sequencing, and/or for further propagation and affinity enrichment.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0503">The library members without the desired specificity are removed by washing. The degree and stringency of washing required will be determined for each peptide sequence or single-chain antibody of interest and the immobilized predetermined macromolecule or epitope. A certain degree of control can be exerted over the binding characteristics of the nascent peptide/DNA complexes recovered by adjusting the conditions of the binding incubation and the subsequent washing. The temperature, pH, ionic strength, divalent cations concentration, and the volume and duration of the washing will select for nascent peptide/DNA complexes within particular ranges of affinity for the immobilized macromolecule. Selection based on slow dissociation rate, which is usually predictive of high affinity, is often the most practical route. This may be done either by continued incubation in the presence of a saturating amount of free predetermined macromolecule, or by increasing the volume, number, and length of the washes. In each case, the rebinding of dissociated nascent peptide/DNA or peptide/RNA complex is prevented, and with increasing time, nascent peptide/DNA or peptide/RNA complexes of higher and higher affinity are recovered.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0504">Additional modifications of the binding and washing procedures may be applied to find peptides with special characteristics. The affinities of some peptides are dependent on ionic strength or cation concentration. This is a useful characteristic for peptides that will be used in affinity purification of various proteins when gentle conditions for removing the protein from the peptides are required.</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0505">One variation involves the use of multiple binding targets (multiple epitope species, multiple receptor species), such that a scfv library can be simultaneously screened for a multiplicity of scfv which have different binding specificities. Given that the size of a scfv library often limits the diversity of potential scfv sequences, it is typically desirable to us scfv libraries of as large a size as possible. The time and economic considerations of generating a number of very large polysome scFv-display libraries can become prohibitive. To avoid this substantial problem, multiple predetermined epitope species (receptor species) can be concomitantly screened in a single library, or sequential screening against a number of epitope species can be used. In one variation, multiple target epitope species, each encoded on a separate bead (or subset of beads), can be mixed and incubated with a polysome-display scfv library under suitable binding conditions. The collection of beads, comprising multiple epitope species, can then be used to isolate, by affinity selection, scfv library members. Generally, subsequent affinity screening rounds can include the same mixture of beads, subsets thereof, or beads containing only one or two individual epitope species. This approach affords efficient screening, and is compatible with laboratory automation, batch processing, and high throughput screening methods.</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0506">A variety of techniques can be used in the present invention to diversify a peptide library or single-chain antibody library, or to diversify, prior to or concomitant with shuffling, around variable segment peptides found in early rounds of panning to have sufficient binding activity to the predetermined macromolecule or epitope. In one approach, the positive selected peptide/polynucleotide complexes (those identified in an early round of affinity enrichment) are sequenced to determine the identity of the active peptides. Oligonucleotides are then synthesized based on these active peptide sequences, employing a low level of all bases incorporated at each step to produce slight variations of the primary oligonucleotide sequences. This mixture of (slightly) degenerate oligonucleotides is then cloned into the variable segment sequences at the appropriate locations. This method produces systematic, controlled variations of the starting peptide sequences, which can then be shuffled. It requires, however, that individual positive nascent peptide/polynucleotide complexes be sequenced before mutagenesis, and thus is useful for expanding the diversity of small numbers of recovered complexes and selecting variants having higher binding affinity and/or higher binding specificity. In a variation, mutagenic PCR amplification of positive selected peptide/polynucleotide complexes (especially of the variable region sequences, the amplification products of which are shuffled in vitro and/or in vivo and one or more additional rounds of screening is done prior to sequencing. The same general approach can be employed with single-chain antibodies in order to expand the diversity and enhance the binding affinity/specificity, typically by diversifying CDRs or adjacent framework regions prior to or concomitant with shuffling. If desired, shuffling reactions can be spiked with mutagenic oligonucleotides capable of in vitro recombination with the selected library members can be included. Thus, mixtures of synthetic oligonucleotides and PCR produced polynucleotides (synthesized by error-prone or high-fidelity methods) can be added to the in vitro shuffling mix and be incorporated into resulting shuffled library members (shufflants).</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0507">The present invention of shuffling enables the generation of a vast library of CDR-variant single-chain antibodies. One way to generate such antibodies is to insert synthetic CDRs into the single-chain antibody and/or CDR randomization prior to or concomitant with shuffling. The sequences of the synthetic CDR cassettes are selected by referring to known sequence data of human CDR and are selected in the discretion of the practitioner according to the following guidelines: synthetic CDRs will have at least 40 percent positional sequence identity to known CDR sequences, and preferably will have at least 50 to 70 percent positional sequence identity to known CDR sequences. For example, a collection of synthetic CDR sequences can be generated by synthesizing a collection of oligonucleotide sequences on the basis of naturally-occurring human CDR sequences listed in Kabat (Kabat et al, 1991); the pool(s) of synthetic CDR sequences are calculated to encode CDR peptide sequences having at least 40 percent sequence identity to at least one known naturally-occurring human CDR sequence. Alternatively, a collection of naturally-occurring CDR sequences may be compared to generate consensus sequences so that amino acids used at a residue position frequently (i.e., in at least 5 percent of known CDR sequences) are incorporated into the synthetic CDRs at the corresponding position(s). Typically, several (e.g., 3 to about 50) known CDR sequences are compared and observed natural sequence variations between the known CDRs are tabulated, and a collection of oligonucleotides encoding CDR peptide sequences encompassing all or most permutations of the observed natural sequence variations is synthesized. For example but not for limitation, if a collection of human VH CDR sequences have carboxy-terminal amino acids which are either Tyr, Val, Phe, or Asp, then the pool(s) of synthetic CDR oligonucleotide sequences are designed to allow the carboxy-terminal CDR residue to be any of these amino acids. In some embodiments, residues other than those which naturally-occur at a residue position in the collection of CDR sequences are incorporated: conservative amino acid substitutions are frequently incorporated and up to 5 residue positions may be varied to incorporate non-conservative amino acid substitutions as compared to known naturally-occurring CDR sequences. Such CDR sequences can be used in primary library members (prior to first round screening) and/or can be used to spike in vitro shuffling reactions of selected library member sequences. Construction of such pools of defined and/or degenerate sequences will be readily accomplished by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0508">The collection of synthetic CDR sequences comprises at least one member that is not known to be a naturally-occurring CDR sequence. It is within the discretion of the practitioner to include or not include a portion of random or pseudorandom sequence corresponding to N region addition in the heavy chain CDR; the N region sequence ranges from 1 nucleotide to about 4 nucleotides occurring at V-D and D-J junctions. A collection of synthetic heavy chain CDR sequences comprises at least about 100 unique CDR sequences, typically at least about 1,000 unique CDR sequences, preferably at least about 10,000 unique CDR sequences, frequently more than 50,000 unique CDR sequences; however, usually not more than about 1&#xd7;106 unique CDR sequences are included in the collection, although occasionally 1&#xd7;107 to 1&#xd7;108 unique CDR sequences are present, especially if conservative amino acid substitutions are permitted at positions where the conservative amino acid substituent is not present or is rare (i.e., less than 0.1 percent) in that position in naturally-occurring human CDRS. In general, the number of unique CDR sequences included in a library should not exceed the expected number of primary transformants in the library by more than a factor of 10. Such single-chain antibodies generally bind of about at least 1&#xd7;10 m-, preferably with an affinity of about at least 5&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>M&#x2212;1, more preferably with an affinity of at least 1&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>M&#x2212;1 to 1&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>M&#x2212;1 or more, sometimes up to 1&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>M&#x2212;1 or more. Frequently, the predetermined antigen is a human protein, such as for example a human cell surface antigen (e. g., CD4, CD8, IL-2 receptor, EGF receptor, PDGF receptor), other human biological macromolecule (e.g., thrombomodulin, protein C, carbohydrate antigen, sialyl Lewis antigen, Lselectin), or nonhuman disease associated macromolecule (e.g., bacterial LPS, virion capsid protein or envelope glycoprotein) and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0509">High affinity single-chain antibodies of the desired specificity can be engineered and expressed in a variety of as systems. For example, scfv have been produced in plants (Firek et al, 1993) and can be readily made in prokaryotic systems (Owens and Young, 1994; Johnson and Bird, 1991). Furthermore, the single-chain antibodies can be used as a basis for constructing whole antibodies or various fragments thereof (Kettleborough et al, 1994). The variable region encoding sequence may be isolated (e.g., by PCR amplification or subcloning) and spliced to a sequence encoding a desired human constant region to encode a human sequence antibody more suitable for human therapeutic uses where immunogenicity is preferably minimized. The polynucleotide(s) having the resultant fully human encoding sequence(s) can be expressed in a host cell (e.g., from an expression vector in a mammalian cell) and purified for pharmaceutical formulation.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0510">The DNA expression constructs will typically include an expression control DNA sequence operably linked to the coding sequences, including naturally-associated or heterologous promoter regions. Preferably, the expression control sequences will be eukaryotic promoter systems in vectors capable of transforming or transfecting eukaryotic host cells. Once the vector has been incorporated into the appropriate host, the host is maintained under conditions suitable for high level expression of the nucleotide sequences, and the collection and purification of the mutant' &#x201c;engineered&#x201d; antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0511">As stated previously, the DNA sequences will be expressed in hosts after the sequences have been operably linked to an expression control sequence (i.e., positioned to ensure the transcription and translation of the structural gene). These expression vectors are typically replicable in the host organisms either as episomes or as an integral part of the host chromosomal DNA. Commonly, expression vectors will contain selection markers, e.g., tetracycline or neomycin, to permit detection of those cells transformed with the desired DNA sequences (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,704,362, which is incorporated herein by reference).</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0512">In addition to eukaryotic microorganisms such as yeast, mammalian tissue cell culture may also be used to produce the polypeptides of the present invention (see Winnacker, 1987), which is incorporated herein by reference). Eukaryotic cells are actually preferred, because a number of suitable host cell lines capable of secreting intact immunoglobulins have been developed in the art, and include the CHO cell lines, various COS cell lines, HeLa cells, and myeloma cell lines, but preferably transformed Bcells or hybridomas. Expression vectors for these cells can include expression control sequences, such as an origin of replication, a promoter, an enhancer (Queen et al, 1986), and necessary processing information sites, such as ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites, and transcriptional terminator sequences. Preferred expression control sequences are promoters derived from immunoglobulin genes, cytomegalovirus, SV40, Adenovirus, Bovine Papilloma Virus, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0513">Eukaryotic DNA transcription can be increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers are cis-acting sequences of between 10 to 300 bp that increase transcription by a promoter. Enhancers can effectively increase transcription when either 51 or 31 to the transcription unit. They are also effective if located within an intron or within the coding sequence itself. Typically, viral enhancers are used, including SV40 enhancers, cytomegalovirus enhancers, polyoma enhancers, and adenovirus enhancers. Enhancer sequences from mammalian systems are also commonly used, such as the mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0514">Mammalian expression vector systems will also typically include a selectable marker gene. Examples of suitable markers include, the dihydrofolate reductase gene (DHFR), the thymidine kinase gene (TK), or prokaryotic genes conferring drug resistance. The first two marker genes prefer the use of mutant cell lines that lack the ability to grow without the addition of thymidine to the growth medium. Transformed cells can then be identified by their ability to grow on non-supplemented media. Examples of prokaryotic drug resistance genes useful as markers include genes conferring resistance to G418, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0515">The vectors containing the DNA segments of interest can be transferred into the host cell by well-known methods, depending on the type of cellular host. For example, calcium chloride transfection is commonly utilized for prokaryotic cells, whereas calcium phosphate treatment. lipofection, or electroporation may be used for other cellular hosts. Other methods used to transform mammalian cells include the use of Polybrene, protoplast fusion, liposomes, electroporation, and micro-injection (see, generally, Sambrook et al, 1982 and 1989).</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0516">Once expressed, the antibodies, individual mutated immunoglobulin chains, mutated antibody fragments, and other immunoglobulin polypeptides of the invention can be purified according to standard procedures of the art, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fraction column chromatography, gel electrophoresis and the like (see. generally, Scopes, 1982). Once purified, partially or to homogeneity as desired, the polypeptides may then be used therapeutically or in developing and performing assay procedures, immunofluorescent stainings, and the like (see, generally, Lefkovits and Pernis, 1979 and 1981; Lefkovits, 1997).</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0517">The antibodies generated by the method of the present invention can be used for diagnosis and therapy. By way of illustration and not limitation, they can be used to treat cancer, autoimmune diseases, or viral infections. For treatment of cancer, the antibodies will typically bind to an antigen expressed preferentially on cancer cells, such as erbB-2, CEA, CD33, and many other antigens and binding members well known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">End-Selection</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0518">This invention provides a method for selecting a subset of polynucleotides from a starting set of polynucleotides, which method is based on the ability to discriminate one or more selectable features (or selection markers) present anywhere in a working polynucleotide, so as to allow one to perform selection for (positive selection) &#x26;/or against (negative selection) each selectable polynucleotide. In a preferred aspect, a method is provided termed end-selection, which method is based on the use of a selection marker located in part or entirely in a terminal region of a selectable polynucleotide, and such a selection marker may be termed an &#x201c;end-selection marker&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0519">End-selection may be based on detection of naturally occurring sequences or on detection of sequences introduced experimentally (including by any mutagenesis procedure mentioned herein and not mentioned herein) or on both, even within the same polynucleotide. An end-selection marker can be a structural selection marker or a functional selection marker or both a structural and a functional selection marker. An end-selection marker may be comprised of a polynucleotide sequence or of a polypeptide sequence or of any chemical structure or of any biological or biochemical tag, including markers that can be selected using methods based on the detection of radioactivity, of enzymatic activity, of fluorescence, of any optical feature, of a magnetic property (e.g. using magnetic beads), of immunoreactivity, and of hybridization.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0520">End-selection may be applied in combination with any method serviceable for performing mutagenesis. Such mutagenesis methods include, but are not limited to, methods described herein (supra and infra). Such methods include, by way of non-limiting exemplification, any method that may be referred herein or by others in the art by any of the following terms: &#x201c;saturation mutagenesis&#x201d;, &#x201c;shuffling&#x201d;, &#x201c;recombination&#x201d;, &#x201c;re-assembly&#x201d;, &#x201c;error-prone PCR&#x201d;, &#x201c;assembly PCR&#x201d;, &#x201c;sexual PCR&#x201d;, &#x201c;crossover PCR&#x201d;; &#x201c;oligonucleotide primer-directed mutagenesis&#x201d;, &#x201c;recursive (&#x26;/or exponential) ensemble mutagenesis (see Arkin and Youvan, 1992)&#x201d;, &#x201c;cassette mutagenesis&#x201d;, &#x201c;in vivo mutagenesis&#x201d;, and &#x201c;in vitro mutagenesis&#x201d;. Moreover, end-selection may be performed on molecules produced by any mutagenesis &#x26;/or amplification method (see, e.g., Arnold, 1993; Caldwell and Joyce, 1992; Stemmer, 1994; following which method it is desirable to select for (including to screen for the presence of) desirable progeny molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0521">In addition, end-selection may be applied to a polynucleotide apart from any mutagenesis method. In a preferred embodiment, end-selection, as provided herein, can be used in order to facilitate a cloning step, such as a step of ligation to another polynucleotide (including ligation to a vector). This invention thus provides for end-selection as a serviceable means to facilitate library construction, selection &#x26;/or enrichment for desirable polynucleotides, and cloning in general.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0522">In a particularly preferred embodiment, end-selection can be based on (positive) selection for a polynucleotide; alternatively end-selection can be based on (negative) selection against a polynucleotide; and alternatively still, end-selection can be based on both (positive) selection for, and on (negative) selection against, a polynucleotide. End-selection, along with other methods of selection &#x26;/or screening, can be performed in an iterative fashion, with any combination of like or unlike selection &#x26;/or screening methods and serviceable mutagenesis methods, all of which can be performed in an iterative fashion and in any order, combination, and permutation.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0523">It is also appreciated that, according to one embodiment of this invention, end-selection may also be used to select a polynucleotide is at least in part: circular (e.g. a plasmid or any other circular vector or any other polynucleotide that is partly circular), &#x26;/or branched, &#x26;/or modified or substituted with any chemical group or moiety. In accord with this embodiment, a polynucleotide may be a circular molecule comprised of an intermediate or central region, which region is flanked on a 5&#x2032; side by a 5&#x2032; flanking region (which, for the purpose of end-selection, serves in like manner to a 5&#x2032; terminal region of a non-circular polynucleotide) and on a 3&#x2032; side by a 3&#x2032; terminal region (which, for the purpose of end-selection, serves in like manner to a 3&#x2032; terminal region of a non-circular polynucleotide). As used in this non-limiting exemplification, there may be sequence overlap between any two regions or even among all three regions.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0524">In one non-limiting aspect of this invention, end-selection of a linear polynucleotide is performed using a general approach based on the presence of at least one end-selection marker located at or near a polynucleotide end or terminus (that can be either a 5&#x2032; end or a 3&#x2032; end). In one particular non-limiting exemplification, end-selection is based on selection for a specific sequence at or near a terminus such as, but not limited to, a sequence recognized by an enzyme that recognizes a polynucleotide sequence. An enzyme that recognizes and catalyzes a chemical modification of a polynucleotide is referred to herein as a polynucleotide-acting enzyme. In a preferred embodiment, serviceable polynucleotide-acting enzymes are exemplified non-exclusively by enzymes with polynucleotide-cleaving activity, enzymes with polynucleotide-methylating activity, enzymes with polynucleotide-ligating activity, and enzymes with a plurality of distinguishable enzymatic activities (including non-exclusively, e.g., both polynucleotide-cleaving activity and polynucleotide-ligating activity).</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0525">Relevant polynucleotide-acting enzymes thus also include any commercially available or non-commercially available polynucleotide endonucleases and their companion methylases including those catalogued at the website http://www.neb.com/rebase, and those mentioned in the following cited reference (Roberts and Macelis, 1996). Preferred polynucleotide endonucleases include&#x2014;but are not limited to&#x2014;type II restriction enzymes (including type IIS), and include enzymes that cleave both strands of a double stranded polynucleotide (e.g. Not I, which cleaves both strands at 5&#x2032; . . . GC/GGCCGC . . . 3&#x2032;) and enzymes that cleave only one strand of a double stranded polynucleotide, i.e. enzymes that have polynucleotide-nicking activity, (e.g. N. BstNB I, which cleaves only one strand at 5&#x2032; . . . GAGTCNNNN/N . . . 3&#x2032; <?insert-start id="REI-00035"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 27)<?insert-end id="REI-00035" ?>). Relevant polynucleotide-acting enzymes also include type III restriction enzymes.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0526">It is appreciated that relevant polynucleotide-acting enzymes also include any enzymes that may be developed in the future, though currently unavailable, that are serviceable for generating a ligation compatible end, preferably a sticky end, in a polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0527">In one preferred exemplification, a serviceable selection marker is a restriction site in a polynucleotide that allows a corresponding type II (or type IIS) restriction enzyme to cleave an end of the polynucleotide so as to provide a ligatable end (including a blunt end or alternatively a sticky end with at least a one base overhang) that is serviceable for a desirable ligation reaction without cleaving the polynucleotide internally in a manner that destroys a desired internal sequence in the polynucleotide. Thus it is provided that, among relevant restriction sites, those sites that do not occur internally (i.e. that do not occur apart from the termini) in a specific working polynucleotide are preferred when the use of a corresponding restriction enzyme(s) is not intended to cut the working polynucleotide internally. This allows one to perform restriction digestion reactions to completion or to near completion without incurring unwanted internal cleavage in a working polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0528">According to a preferred aspect, it is thus preferable to use restriction sites that are not contained, or alternatively that are not expected to be contained, or alternatively that unlikely to be contained (e.g. when sequence information regarding a working polynucleotide is incomplete) internally in a polynucleotide to be subjected to end-selection. In accordance with this aspect, it is appreciated that restriction sites that occur relatively infrequently are usually preferred over those that occur more frequently. On the other hand it is also appreciated that there are occasions where internal cleavage of a polypeptide is desired, e.g. to achieve recombination or other mutagenic procedures along with end-selection.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0529">In accord with this invention, it is also appreciated that methods (e.g. mutagenesis methods) can be used to remove unwanted internal restriction sites. It is also appreciated that a partial digestion reaction (i.e. a digestion reaction that proceeds to partial completion) can be used to achieve digestion at a recognition site in a terminal region while sparing a susceptible restriction site that occurs internally in a polynucleotide and that is recognized by the same enzyme. In one aspect, partial digest are useful because it is appreciated that certain enzymes show preferential cleavage of the same recognition sequence depending on the location and environment in which the recognition sequence occurs. For example, it is appreciated that, while lambda DNA has 5 EcoR I sites, cleavage of the site nearest to the right terminus has been reported to occur 10 times faster than the sites in the middle of the molecule. Also, for example, it has been reported that, while Sac II has four sites on lambda DNA, the three clustered centrally in lambda are cleaved 50 times faster than the remaining site near the terminus (at nucleotide 40,386). Summarily, site preferences have been reported for various enzymes by many investigators (e.g., Thomas and Davis, 1975; Forsblum et al, 1976; Nath and Azzolina, 1981; Brown and Smith, 1977; Gingeras and Brooks, 1983; Kr&#xfc;ger et al, 1988; Conrad and Topal, 1989; Oller et al, 1991; Topal, 1991; and Pein, 1991; to name but a few). It is appreciated that any empirical observations as well as any mechanistic understandings of site preferences by any serviceable polynucleotide-acting enzymes, whether currently available or to be procured in the future, may be serviceable in end-selection according to this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0530">It is also appreciated that protection methods can be used to selectively protect specified restriction sites (e.g. internal sites) against unwanted digestion by enzymes that would otherwise cut a working polypeptide in response to the presence of those sites; and that such protection methods include modifications such as methylations and base substitutions (e.g. U instead of T) that inhibit an unwanted enzyme activity. It is appreciated that there are limited numbers of available restriction enzymes that are rare enough (e.g. having very long recognition sequences) to create large (e.g. megabase-long) restriction fragments, and that protection approaches (e.g. by methylation) are serviceable for increasing the rarity of enzyme cleavage sites. The use of M.Fnu II (mCGCG) to increase the apparent rarity of Not I approximately twofold is but one example among many (Qiang et al, 1990; Nelson et al, 1984; Maxam and Gilbert, 1980; Raleigh and Wilson, 1986).</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0531">According to a preferred aspect of this invention, it is provided that, in general, the use of rare restriction sites is preferred. It is appreciated that, in general, the frequency of occurrence of a restriction site is determined by the number of nucleotides contained therein, as well as by the ambiguity of the base requirements contained therein. Thus, in a non-limiting exemplification, it is appreciated that, in general, a restriction site composed of, for example, 8 specific nucleotides (e.g. the Not I site or GC/GGCCGC, with an estimated relative occurrence of 1 in 4<sup>8</sup>, i.e. 1 in 65,536, random 8-mers) is relatively more infrequent than one composed of, for example, 6 nucleotides (e.g. the Sma I site or CCC/GGG, having an estimated relative occurrence of 1 in 4<sup>6</sup>, i.e. 1 in 4,096, random 6-mers), which in turn is relatively more infrequent than one composed of, for example, 4 nucleotides (e.g. the Msp I site or C/CGG, having an estimated relative occurrence of 1 in 4<sup>4</sup>, i.e. 1 in 256, random 4-mers). Moreover, in another non-limiting exemplification, it is appreciated that, in general, a restriction site having no ambiguous (but only specific) base requirements (e.g. the Fin I site or GTCCC, having an estimated relative occurrence of 1 in 4<sup>5</sup>, i.e. 1 in 1024, random 5-mers) is relatively more infrequent than one having an ambiguous W (where W=A or T) base requirement (e.g. the Ava II site or G/GWCC, having an estimated relative occurrence of 1 in 4&#xd7;4&#xd7;2&#xd7;4&#xd7;4&#x2014;i.e. 1 in 512&#x2014;random 5-mers), which in turn is relatively more infrequent than one having an ambiguous N (where N=A or C or G or T) base requirement (e.g. the Asu I site or G/GNCC, having an estimated relative occurrence of 1 in 4&#xd7;4&#xd7;1&#xd7;4&#xd7;4, i.e. I in 256&#x2014;random 5-mers). These relative occurrences are considered general estimates for actual polynucleotides, because it is appreciated that specific nucleotide bases (not to mention specific nucleotide sequences) occur with dissimilar frequencies in specific polynucleotides, in specific species of organisms, and in specific groupings of organisms. For example, it is appreciated that the % G+C contents of different species of organisms are often very different and wide ranging.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0532">The use of relatively more infrequent restriction sites as a selection marker include&#x2014;in a non-limiting fashion&#x2014;preferably those sites composed at least a 4 nucleotide sequence, more preferably those composed at least a 5 nucleotide sequence, more preferably still those composed at least a 6 nucleotide sequence (e.g. the BamH I site or G/GATCC, the Bgl II site or A/GATCT, the Pst I site or CTGCA/G, and the Xba I site or T/CTAGA), more preferably still those composed at least a 7 nucleotide sequence, more preferably still those composed of an 8 nucleotide sequence nucleotide sequence (e.g. the Asc I site or GG/CGCGCC, the Not I site or GC/GGCCGC, the Pac-I site or TTAAT/TAA, the Pme I site or GTTT/AAAC, the Srf I site or GCCC/GGGC, the Sse838 I site or CCTGCA/GG, and the Swa I site or ATTT/AAAT), more preferably still those composed of a 9 nucleotide sequence, and even more preferably still those composed of at least a 10 nucleotide sequence (e.g. the BspG I site or CG/CGCTGGAC <?insert-start id="REI-00036"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 28)<?insert-end id="REI-00036" ?>). It is further appreciated that some restriction sites (e.g. for class IIS enzymes) are comprised of a portion of relatively high specificity (i.e. a portion containing a principal determinant of the frequency of occurrence of the restriction site) and a portion of relatively low specificity; and that a site of cleavage may or may not be contained within a portion of relatively low specificity. For example, in the Eco57 I site or CTGAAG(16/14) <?insert-start id="REI-00037"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 24)<?insert-end id="REI-00037" ?>, there is a portion of relatively high specificity (i.e. the CTGAAG portion) and a portion of relatively low specificity (i.e. the N16 sequence) that contains a site of cleavage.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0533">In another preferred embodiment of this invention, a serviceable end-selection marker is a terminal sequence that is recognized by a polynucleotide-acting enzyme that recognizes a specific polynucleotide sequence. In a preferred aspect of this invention, serviceable polynucleotide-acting enzymes also include other enzymes in addition to classic type II restriction enzymes. According to this preferred aspect of this invention, serviceable polynucleotide-acting enzymes also include gyrases, helicases, recombinases, relaxases, and any enzymes related thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0534">Among preferred examples are topoisomerases (which have been categorized by some as a subset of the gyrases) and any other enzymes that have polynucleotide-cleaving activity (including preferably polynucleotide-nicking activity) &#x26;/or polynucleotide-ligating activity. Among preferred topoisomerase enzymes are topoisomerase I enzymes, which is available from many commercial sources (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, Wis.; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.; Life Technologies, <?delete-start id="REI-00038"  date="20150120" ?>Gathesburg<?delete-end id="REI-00038" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00039"  date="20150120" ?>Gaithersburg<?insert-end id="REI-00039" ?>, Md.) and conceivably even more private sources. It is appreciated that similar enzymes may be developed in the future that are serviceable for end-selection as provided herein. A particularly preferred topoisomerase I enzyme is a topoisomerase I enzyme of vaccinia virus origin, that has a specific recognition sequence (e.g. 5&#x2032; . . . AAGGG . . . 3&#x2032;) and has both polynucleotide-nicking activity and polynucleotide-ligating activity. Due to the specific nicking-activity of this enzyme (cleavage of one strand), internal recognition sites are not prone to polynucleotide destruction resulting from the nicking activity (but rather remain annealed) at a temperature that causes denaturation of a terminal site that has been nicked. Thus for use in end-selection, it is preferable that a nicking site for topoisomerase-based end-selection be no more than 100 nucleotides from a terminus, more preferably no more than 50 nucleotides from a terminus, more preferably still no more than 25 <?delete-start id="REI-00040"  date="20150120" ?>nucloetides<?delete-end id="REI-00040" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00041"  date="20150120" ?>nucleotides <?insert-end id="REI-00041" ?>from a terminus, even more preferably still no more than 20 nucleotides from a terminus, even more preferably still no more than 15 nucleotides from a terminus, even more preferably still no more than 10 nucleotides from a terminus, even more preferably still no more than 8 nucleotides from a terminus, even more preferably still no more than 6 nucleotides from a terminus, and even more preferably still no more than 4 nucleotides from a terminus.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0535">In a particularly preferred exemplification that is non-limiting yet clearly illustrative, it is appreciated that when a nicking site for topoisomerase-based end-selection is 4 nucleotides from a terminus, nicking produces a single stranded oligo of 4 bases (in a terminal region) that can be denatured from its complementary strand in an end-selectable polynucleotide; this provides a sticky end (comprised of 4 bases) in a polynucleotide that is serviceable for an ensuing ligation reaction. To accomplish ligation to a cloning vector (preferably an expression vector), compatible sticky ends can be generated in a cloning vector by any means including by restriction enzyme-based means. The terminal nucleotides (comprised of 4 terminal bases in this specific example) in an end-selectable polynucleotide terminus are thus wisely chosen to provide compatibility with a sticky end generated in a cloning vector to which the polynucleotide is to be ligated.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0536">On the other hand, internal nicking of an end-selectable polynucleotide, e.g. 500 bases from a terminus, produces a single stranded oligo of 500 bases that is not easily denatured from its complementary strand, but rather is serviceable for repair (e.g. by the same topoisomerase enzyme that produced the nick).</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0537">This invention thus provides a method&#x2014;e.g. that is vaccinia topoisomerase-based &#x26;/or type II (or IIS) restriction endonuclease-based &#x26;/or type III restriction endonuclease-based &#x26;/or nicking enzyme-based (e.g. using N. BstNB I)&#x2014;for producing a sticky end in a working polynucleotide, which end is ligation compatible, and which end can be comprised of at least a 1 base overhang. Preferably such a sticky end is comprised of at least a 2-base overhang, more preferably such a sticky end is comprised of at least a 3-base overhang, more preferably still such a sticky end is comprised of at least a 4-base overhang, even more preferably still such a sticky end is comprised of at least a 5-base overhang, even more preferably still such a sticky end is comprised of at least a 6-base overhang. Such a sticky end may also be comprised of at least a 7-base overhang, or at least an 8-base overhang, or at least a 9-base overhang, or at least a 10-base overhang, or at least 15-base overhang, or at least a 20-base overhang, or at least a 25-base overhang, or at least a 30-base overhang. These overhangs can be comprised of any bases, including A, C, G, or T.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0538">It is appreciated that sticky end overhangs introduced using topoisomerase or a nicking enzyme (e.g. using N. BstNB I) can be designed to be unique in a ligation environment, so as to prevent unwanted fragment reassemblies, such as self-dimerizations and other unwanted concatamerizations.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0539">According to one aspect of this invention, a plurality of sequences (which may but do not necessarily overlap) can be introduced into a terminal region of an end-selectable polynucleotide by the use of an oligo in a polymerase-based reaction. In a relevant, but by no means limiting example, such an oligo can be used to provide a preferred 5&#x2032; terminal region that is serviceable for topoisomerase I-based end-selection, which oligo is comprised of: a 1-10 base sequence that is convertible into a sticky end (preferably by a vaccinia topoisomerase 1), a ribosome binding site (i.e. and &#x201c;RBS&#x201d;, that is preferably serviceable for expression cloning), and optional linker sequence followed by an ATG start site and a template-specific sequence of 0-100 bases (to facilitate annealment to the template in a polymerase-based reaction). Thus, according to this example, a serviceable oligo (which may be termed a forward primer) can have the sequence: 5&#x2032;[terminal sequence=(N)<sub>1-10</sub>][topoisomerase I site &#x26; RBS=AAGGGAGGAG][linker=(N)<sub>1-110</sub>][start codon and template-specific sequence=ATG(N)<sub>0-100</sub>]3&#x2032; <?insert-start id="REI-00042"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 29)<?insert-end id="REI-00042" ?>.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0540">Analogously, in a relevant, but by no means limiting example, an oligo can be used to provide a preferred 3&#x2032; terminal region that is serviceable for topoisomerase I-based end-selection, which oligo is comprised of: a 1-10 base sequence that is convertible into a sticky end (preferably by a vaccinia topoisomerase I), and optional linker sequence followed by a template-specific sequence of 0-100 bases (to facilitate annealment to the template in a polymerase-based reaction). Thus, according to this example, a serviceable oligo (which may be termed a reverse primer) can have the sequence: 5&#x2032;[terminal sequence=(N)<sub>1-10</sub>][topoisomerase I site=AAGGG][linker=(N)<sub>1-100</sub>][template-specific sequence=(N)<sub>1-100</sub>]3&#x2032; <?insert-start id="REI-00043"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 30)<?insert-end id="REI-00043" ?>.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0541">It is appreciated that, end-selection can be used to distinguish and separate parental template molecules (e.g. to be subjected to mutagenesis) from progeny molecules (e.g. generated by mutagenesis). For example, a first set of primers, lacking in a topoisomerase I recognition site, can be used to modify the terminal regions of the parental molecules (e.g. in polymerase-based amplification). A different second set of primers (e.g. having a topoisomerase I recognition site) can then be used to generate mutated progeny molecules (e.g. using any polynucleotide chimerization method, such as interrupted synthesis, template-switching polymerase-based amplification, or interrupted synthesis; or using saturation mutagenesis; or using any other method for introducing a topoisomerase I recognition site into a mutagenized progeny molecule as disclosed herein) from the amplified template molecules. The use of topoisomerase I-based end-selection can then facilitate, not only discernment, but selective topoisomerase I-based ligation of the desired progeny molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0542">Annealment of a second set of primers to thusly amplified parental molecules can be facilitated by including sequences in a first set of primers (i.e. primers used for amplifying a set parental molecules) that are similar to a toposiomerase I recognition site, yet different enough to prevent functional toposiomerase I enzyme recognition. For example, sequences that diverge from the AAGGG site by anywhere from 1 base to all 5 bases can be incorporated into a first set of primers (to be used for amplifying the parental templates prior to subjection to mutagenesis). In a specific, but non-limiting aspect, it is thus provided that a parental molecule can be amplified using the following exemplary&#x2014;but by no means limiting&#x2014;set of forward and reverse primers:

    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0545">According to this specific example of a first set of primers, (N)<sub>10-100 </sub>represents preferably a 10 to 100 nucleotide-long template-specific sequence, more preferably a 10 to 50 nucleotide-long template-specific sequence, more preferably still a 10 to 30 nucleotide-long template-specific sequence, and even more preferably still a 15 to 25 nucleotide-long template-specific sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0546">According to a specific, but non-limiting aspect, it is thus provided that, after this amplification (using a disclosed first set of primers lacking in a true topoisomerase I recognition site), amplified parental molecules can then be subjected to mutagenesis using one or more sets of forward and reverse primers that do have a true topoisomerase I recognition site. In a specific, but non-limiting aspect, it is thus provided that a parental molecule can be used as templates for the generation of a mutagenized progeny molecule using the following exemplary&#x2014;but by no means limiting&#x2014;second set of forward and reverse primers:
<ul id="ul0032" list-style="none">

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0549">It is appreciated that any number of different primers sets not specifically mentioned can be used as first, second, or subsequent sets of primers for end-selection consistent with this invention. Notice that type II restriction enzyme sites can be incorporated (e.g. an Asc I site in the above example). It is provided that, in addition to the other sequences mentioned, the experimentalist can incorporate one or more N,N,G/T triplets into a serviceable primer in order to subject a working polynucleotide to saturation mutagenesis. Summarily, use of a second and/or subsequent set of primers can achieve dual goals of introducing a topoisomerase I site and of generating mutations in a progeny polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0437" num="0550">Thus, according to one use provided, a serviceable end-selection marker is an enzyme recognition site that allows an enzyme to cleave (including nick) a polynucleotide at a specified site, to produce a ligation-compatible end upon denaturation of a generated single stranded oligo. Ligation of the produced polynucleotide end can then be accomplished by the same enzyme (e.g. in the case of vaccinia virus topoisomerase I), or alternatively with the use of a different enzyme. According to one aspect of this invention, any serviceable end-selection markers, whether like (e.g. two vaccinia virus topoisomerase I recognition sites) or unlike (e.g. a class II restriction enzyme recognition site and a vaccinia virus topoisomerase I recognition site) can be used in combination to select a polynucleotide. Each selectable polynucleotide can thus have one or more end-selection markers, and they can be like or unlike end-selection markers. In a particular aspect, a plurality of end-selection markers can be located on one end of a polynucleotide and can have overlapping sequences with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0438" num="0551">It is important to emphasize that any number of enzymes, whether currently in existence or to be developed, can be serviceable in end-selection according to this invention. For example, in a particular aspect of this invention, a nicking enzyme (e.g. N. BstNB I, which cleaves only one strand at 5&#x2032; . . . GAGTCNNNN/N . . . 3&#x2032; <?insert-start id="REI-00048"  date="20150120" ?>(SEQ ID NO: 27)<?insert-end id="REI-00048" ?>) can be used in conjunction with a source of polynucleotide-ligating activity in order to achieve end-selection. According to this embodiment, a recognition site for N. BstNB I&#x2014;instead of a recognition site for topoisomerase I&#x2014;should be incorporated into an end-selectable polynucleotide (whether end-selection is used for selection of a mutagenized progeny molecule or whether end-selection is used apart from any mutagenesis procedure).</p>
<p id="p-0439" num="0552">It is appreciated that the instantly disclosed end-selection approach using topoisomerase-based nicking and ligation has several advantages over previously available selection methods. In sum, this approach allows one to achieve direction cloning (including expression cloning). Specifically, this approach can be used for the achievement of: direct ligation (i.e. without subjection to a classic restriction-purification-ligation reaction, that is susceptible to a multitude of potential problems from an initial restriction reaction to a ligation reaction dependent on the use of T4 DNA ligase); separation of progeny molecules from original template molecules (e.g. original template molecules lack topoisomerase I sites that not introduced until after mutagenesis), obviation of the need for size separation steps (e.g. by gel chromatography or by other electrophoretic means or by the use of size-exclusion membranes), preservation of internal sequences (even when topoisomerase I sites are present), obviation of concerns about unsuccessful ligation reactions (e.g. dependent on the use of T4 DNA ligase, particularly in the presence of unwanted residual restriction enzyme activity), and facilitated expression cloning (including obviation of frame shift concerns). Concerns about unwanted restriction enzyme-based cleavages&#x2014;especially at internal restriction sites (or even at often unpredictable sites of unwanted star activity) in a working polynucleotide&#x2014;that are potential sites of destruction of a working polynucleotide can also be obviated by the instantly disclosed end-selection approach using topoisomerase-based nicking and ligation.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Two-Hybrid Based Screening Assays</p>
<p id="p-0440" num="0553">Shuffling can also be used to recombinatorially diversify a pool of selected library members obtained by screening a two-hybrid screening system to identify library members which bind a predetermined polypeptide sequence. The selected library members are pooled and shuffled by in vitro and/or in vivo recombination. The shuffled pool can then be screened in a yeast two hybrid system to select library members which bind said predetermined polypeptide sequence (e. g., and SH2 domain) or which bind an alternate predetermined polypeptide sequence (e.g., an SH2 domain from another protein species).</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0554">An approach to identifying polypeptide sequences which bind to a predetermined polypeptide sequence has been to use a so-called &#x201c;two-hybrid&#x201d; system wherein the predetermined polypeptide sequence is present in a fusion protein (Chien et al, 1991). This approach identifies protein-protein interactions in vivo through reconstitution of a transcriptional activator (Fields and Song, 1989), the yeast Gal4 transcription protein. Typically, the method is based on the properties of the yeast Gal4 protein, which consists of separable domains responsible for DNA-binding and transcriptional activation. Polynucleotides encoding two hybrid proteins, one consisting of the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to a polypeptide sequence of a known protein and the other consisting of the Gal4 activation domain fused to a polypeptide sequence of a second protein, are constructed and introduced into a yeast host cell. Intermolecular binding between the two fusion proteins reconstitutes the Gal4 DNA-binding domain with the Gal4 activation domain, which leads to the transcriptional activation of a reporter gene (e.g., lacz, HIS3) which is operably linked to a Gal4 binding site. Typically, the two-hybrid method is used to identify novel polypeptide sequences which interact with a known protein (Silver and Hunt, 1993; Durfee et al, 1993; Yang et al, 1992; Luban et al, 1993; Hardy et al, 1992; Bartel et al, 1993; and Vojtek et al, 1993). However, variations of the two-hybrid method have been used to identify mutations of a known protein that affect its binding to a second known protein (Li and Fields, 1993; Lalo et al, 1993; Jackson et al, 1993; and Madura et al, 1993). Two-hybrid systems have also been used to identify interacting structural domains of two known proteins (Bardwell et al, 1993; Chakrabarty et al, 1992; Staudinger et al, 1993; and Milne and Weaver 1993) or domains responsible for oligomerization of a single protein (Iwabuchi et al, 1993; Bogerd et al, 1993). Variations of two-hybrid systems have been used to study the in vivo activity of a proteolytic enzyme (Dasmahapatra et al, 1992). Alternatively, an E. coli/BCCP interactive screening system (Germino et al, 1993; Guarente, 1993) can be used to identify interacting protein sequences (i.e., protein sequences which heterodimerize or form higher order heteromultimers). Sequences selected by a two-hybrid system can be pooled and shuffled and introduced into a two-hybrid system for one or more subsequent rounds of screening to identify polypeptide sequences which bind to the hybrid containing the predetermined binding sequence. The sequences thus identified can be compared to identify consensus sequence(s) and consensus sequence kernals.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0555">In general, standard techniques of recombination DNA technology are described in various publications (e.g. Sambrook et al, 1989; Ausubel et al, 1987; and Berger and Kimmel, 1987) each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Polynucleotide modifying enzymes were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Inc. Model 394 DNA synthesizer using ABI chemicals. If desired, PCR amplimers for amplifying a predetermined DNA sequence may be selected at the discretion of the practitioner.</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0556">One microgram samples of template DNA are obtained and treated with U.V. light to cause the formation of dimers, including TT dimers, particularly purine dimers. U.V. exposure is limited so that only a few photoproducts are generated per gene on the template DNA sample. Multiple samples are treated with U.V. light for varying periods of time to obtain template DNA samples with varying numbers of dimers from U.V. exposure.</p>

<p id="p-0445" num="0558">The present invention is further directed to a method for generating a selected mutant polynucleotide sequence (or a population of selected polynucleotide sequences) typically in the form of amplified and/or cloned polynucleotides, whereby the selected polynucleotide sequences(s) possess at least one desired phenotypic characteristic (e.g., encodes a polypeptide, promotes transcription of linked polynucleotides, binds a protein, and the like) which can be selected for. One method for identifying hybrid polypeptides that possess a desired structure or functional property, such as binding to a predetermined biological macromolecule (e.g., a receptor), involves the screening of a large library of polypeptides for individual library members which possess the desired structure or functional property conferred by the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide.</p>

The method comprises (1) obtaining a first plurality of selected library members comprising a displayed polypeptide or displayed antibody and an associated polynucleotide encoding said displayed polypeptide or displayed antibody, and obtaining said associated polynucleotides or copies thereof wherein said associated polynucleotides comprise a region of substantially identical sequences, optimally introducing mutations into said polynucleotides or copies, (2) pooling the polynucleotides or copies, (3) producing smaller or shorter polynucleotides by interrupting a random or particularized priming and synthesis process or an amplification process, and (4) performing amplification, preferably PCR amplification, and optionally mutagenesis to homologously recombine the newly synthesized polynucleotides.</p>

<heading id="h-0022" level="1">Generation of Random Size Polynucleotides Using U.V. Induced Photoproducts</heading>
<p id="p-0452" num="0572">One microgram samples of template DNA are obtained and treated with U.V. light to cause the formation of dimers, including TT dimers, particularly purine dimers. U.V. exposure is limited so that only a few photoproducts are generated per gene on the template DNA sample. Multiple samples are treated with U.V. light for varying periods of time to obtain template DNA samples with varying numbers of dimers from U.V. exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0573">A random priming kit which utilizes a non-proofreading polymerase (for example, Prime-It II Random Primer Labeling kit by Stratagene Cloning Systems) is utilized to generate different size polynucleotides by priming at random sites on templates which are prepared by U.V. light (as described above) and extending along the templates. The priming protocols such as described in the Prime-It II Random Primer Labeling kit may be utilized to extend the primers. The dimers formed by U.V. exposure serve as a roadblock for the extension by the non-proofreading polymerase. Thus, a pool of random size polynucleotides is present after extension with the random primers is finished.</p>

The mixture is incubated at 50&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes and 10 &#x3bc;l of glass milk (Bio 101) is added. The mixture is spun for 1 minute and the supernatant is decanted. The pellet is washed with 500 &#x3bc;l of Column Wash (Column Wash is 50% ethanol, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and 2.5 mM EDTA) and spin for 1 minute, after which the supernatant is decanted. The washing, spinning and decanting steps are then repeated. The glass milk pellet is resuspended in 20 &#x3bc;l of H<sub>2</sub>O and spun for 1 minute. DNA remains in the aqueous phase.</p>

<p id="p-0474" num="0627">The objective can be, e.g., to reassemble/shuffle molecules of DNA to generate gene libraries of specific genes, libraries of gene families, and libraries of unrelated genes. The synthesis of the full-length molecules is carried out on a solid support. As solid support we use paramagnetic beads coated with Streptavidin. The principle is based on the strong interaction between Biotin and Streptavidin and the ability to stepwise or <?delete-start id="REI-00061"  date="20150120" ?>simulataneously<?delete-end id="REI-00061" ?> <?insert-start id="REI-00062"  date="20150120" ?>simultaneously <?insert-end id="REI-00062" ?>ligate DNA fragments generated from the annealing of nucleic acid building blocks (such as ssDNA building blocks). The use of a solid support facilitates the reassembly of nucleic acid building blocks in a sequential manner and thus allows one to use not only unique couplings, but also redundant or repeated couplings throughout the length of a nucleic acid molecule that is to be generated by ligation reassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0628">A &#x201c;capture oligonucleotide&#x201d; is biotinylated at the 5&#x2032; end for binding to the beads.

The double stranded capture fragment contains two restriction sites at the 5&#x2032;-end which allows release of the assembled molecules from the solid support.</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0629">Ligation reassembly is performed by step-wise ligation of annealed oligonucleotides of 20-100 bases. The first fragment of the assembly contains a 5&#x2032;-end compatible with the 3&#x2032;-end of the capture biotinylated fragment. Consecutive ligation of double stranded fragments containing complementary ends allows the generation of full-length molecules.

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Methods of delivering optical stimulation to a target tissue from an optical stimulation device are provided. One method comprises sensing a temperature at the optical stimulation device or proximate to the optical stimulation device, and adjusting the delivery of light to the target tissue based on the sensed temperature. Another method comprises delivering the light to the target tissue with an optical light guide and sensing bioelectric signals with a sense electrode, wherein the optical light guide and the sense electrode each comprise a material that produces substantially no induced current in an electromagnetic field. Another method comprises delivering light from a light source of an optical stimulation device to a window of the optical stimulation device, delivering the light from the window to an optical light guide optically connected to the window, and delivering the light to a target tissue via the optical light guide.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The Sequence Listing in accordance with 37 C.F.R. &#xa7;&#xa7;1.821-1.824 associated with this application is provided in text format in lieu of a paper copy, and is hereby incorporated by reference into the specification in its entirety. The name of the text file containing the Sequence Listing is &#x201c;SEQUENCELISTING.txt.&#x201d; The text file is 18 KB, was created on Feb. 5, 2010, and is being submitted electronically via EFS-Web.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosure relates to optical stimulation therapy.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electrical stimulation of neural tissue serves as the core of many neurological therapies, and can provide relief for a variety of disorders, improving the quality of life for many patients. In some cases, electrical stimulation may be characterized by a lack of specificity in the excitation of neural tissue. In particular, it can be difficult to stimulate a specific, localized neural population due to constraints on electrode geometry and placement. For example, the area of stimulation may be dictated by electrode size, which can be generally orders of magnitude greater than the cellular targets of interest. In some cases, this may lead to overexciting cellular networks and or inefficient stimulation, and may result in stimulation of non-target cells. In addition, inhibitory stimuli through the use of electrical coupling generally may be accomplished only through a electrical stimulation block that involves inefficient, high frequency stimulation, thereby limiting the therapy modulation strategy in some circumstances. The presence of electrodes in tissue may also place limitations on electromagnetic exposure from electromagnetic sources such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electrosurgery devices. In addition, electrical stimulation can undermine the ability to sense underlying electrical neural activity simultaneously with delivery of electrical stimulation. In particular, electrical stimulation currents flowing through the tissue that are necessary to achieve a localized current density high enough to depolarize the cell or axon can mask the bioelectrical activity to be sensed.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the disclosure describes devices for delivering optical stimulation and techniques for delivering optical stimulation to neural tissue from an optical stimulation device. The optical stimulation device, in some examples, may deliver optical stimulation configured to support optogenetic neuromodulation. For optogenetic neuromodulation, cellular control and interfacing is achieved by activating light-sensitive channel proteins, also referred to as opsins that are embedded in desired neuronal populations. Opsins are expressed on the neuronal membrane by lentiviral or retroviral-based delivery of their genes, allowing for direct cellular targeting through genetic mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As examples, two microbial opsins, Channelrhodopsin-2 (cation channel activated by &#x2dc;450 nm light) and Halorhodopsin (chloride pump activated by &#x2dc;580 nm light) may be suitable for optogenetic stimulation, as they provide a mechanism to modulate neural information flow by respectively exciting and inhibiting action potentials in neural networks.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The disclosure, in some examples, describes optical stimulation techniques, such as optogenetic stimulation techniques. The techniques may be capable of exciting or inhibiting neural activity in target neuron populations. For optogenetic stimulation, the target neurons may be selectively transfected with genes that express opsins that are activated by light emitted into the target tissue. The light may be selected to activate an opsin to initiate neuronal spikes or to deactivate or inhibit an opsin to cease or prevent neuronal spikes. The light may also be selected to activate an opsin to suppress a neuronal spike. An optogenetic stimulation system may be configured as an implantable medical device that can deliver optical stimulation through implantable optical fibers or other light-delivery apparatus to a target tissue, such as to specific or highly specific neuron populations. The high degree of specificity provided by the optical stimulation may limit or prevent stimulation of non-target tissue, possibly reducing side effects of stimulation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As non-limiting examples, the optical stimulation may be delivered to target tissue within the brain or spinal cord of a human patient. However, the disclosure is not so limited. Rather, optical stimulation may be delivered to any of a variety of target tissue sites to support any of a variety or therapies. A few examples include without limitation cardiac tissue to support cardiac therapy such as pacing, cardioversion, defibrillation, resynchronization, or other therapies, gastrointestinal tissue to support gastrointestinal therapy such as therapy to address obesity, motility disorders (e.g., gastroparesis), dyspepsia, or other therapies, pelvic floor tissue (e.g., sacral or pudendal nerve tissue) to support pelvic floor therapy such as pain therapy, urinary or fecal incontinence therapy, sexual dysfunction, or other therapies, or cranial tissue to support cranial nerve therapy such as therapy to relieve occipital neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, facial pain, migraine headaches, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one example, the optogenetic stimulation system may also include a therapeutic agent delivery system, such as a pump, to deliver a therapeutic agent capable of transfecting the target neurons with the genes to express the opsins described above, such as a liquid gene therapy agent including a lentiviral or retroviral vector for transfecting the target neurons. The therapeutic agent delivery system may provide regular, irregular, programmed, or clinician-activated doses of the therapeutic agent to the target neurons to ensure that the target neurons continue to express the desired opsins. In another example, the optogenetic stimulation system may also include sensing electrodes that sense electrical signals within the patient, such as to provide a closed-feedback loop for the control of the optical stimulation provided by the optogenetic stimulation system.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The optogenetic system may be fully implantable in the patient. In other examples, some portions of the optogenetic stimulation system may be implantable in the patient, while other components are configured to be external to the patient. For example, one or more programmers may be external to the patient, and communicate with an implanted stimulation device via wireless telemetry. In other cases, a stimulation generator may be external to the body, and be configured to deliver light, receive sensed signals, and/or deliver fluid via percutaneously implanted optical delivery elements (such as optical fibers), leads and/or conduits. Optical fibers will be described for purposes of illustration, but without limitation as the use of other types of optical delivery elements. In some cases, optical fibers, electrical leads, or fluid delivery conduits may be constructed as separate elements, or two or more of such components combined with one another in a lead or other elongated element.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example system <b>2</b> that may be used to deliver stimulation therapy to patient <b>6</b>. Patient <b>6</b> ordinarily, but not necessarily, will be a human. Generally, therapy system <b>2</b> includes an implantable stimulator <b>4</b> that delivers optical stimulation, such as light <b>15</b>, to patient <b>6</b> via one or more implantable optical fibers <b>11</b>. The terms &#x201c;light&#x201d; or &#x201c;optical light&#x201d; as used herein refer to electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength and intensity that has a physiologically measurable effect and may include visible light, infrared light, and ultraviolet light. In some examples, light that may be used to provide the optical stimulation of system <b>2</b> may include visible light having a wavelength of between about 380 nm and about 750 nm, infrared light having a wavelength of between about 700 nm and about 300 &#x3bc;m, and ultraviolet light having a wavelength between about 10 nm and about 400 nm. For example, a first optical fiber <b>11</b>A may deliver visible light having a certain wavelength and intensity, and a second optical fiber <b>11</b>B may deliver visible light having the same wavelength and intensity, or a different wavelength at the same intensity, or the same wavelength and a different intensity, or the second optical fiber <b>11</b>B may deliver non-visible light, such as infrared or ultraviolet light. The fibers <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B may be coupled to the same light source or different light sources. In some cases, a single light source may be optically multiplexed across the fibers <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B to deliver light via the different fibers at different times. In some examples, the light source may deliver light via both fibers <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B simultaneously. The light delivered via one optical fiber <b>11</b>A may be the same as the light delivered via another optical fiber <b>11</b>B, e.g., in terms of characteristics or parameters such as wavelength, amplitude, pulse width or pulse rate. Alternatively, the light delivered via the optical fibers <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B may have different characteristics or parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The implantable optical fibers <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B may be deployed to a target site as part of one or more bundles of optical fibers, such as implantable optical fiber bundle <b>10</b>, or separately. In some cases, stereotactic or other positioning techniques may be used to precisely position the optical fibers with respect to target tissue sites. If only one optical fiber <b>11</b> is implanted, instead of multiple fibers, then fiber bundle <b>10</b> and the single optical fiber <b>11</b> may be one and the same. The optical stimulation may be in the form of optical light of a particular wavelength and may be delivered as pulses, e.g., with a defined pulse width and pulse rate. Various parameters of the pulses may be defined by a stimulation program. The pulses may be delivered substantially continuously for a relatively long period of time, such as several seconds or more, or in pulse bursts, segments, or patterns, and may be delivered alone or in combination with pulses defined by one or more other stimulation programs. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a fully implantable stimulator <b>4</b>, techniques described in this disclosure may be applied to external stimulators having optical fibers deployed via percutaneously implantable leads. In addition, in some examples, system <b>2</b> may include sense electrodes deployed within patient <b>6</b>, such as implantable sense electrodes <b>17</b> implanted on leads <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B alongside optical fibers <b>11</b> and/or a sense electrode located on a housing <b>14</b>, i.e., &#x201c;can&#x201d; or &#x201c;case,&#x201d; of the implantable stimulator <b>4</b>. Leads <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B may be implanted side-by-side with optical fibers <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B, respectively, and fastened or formed together. In other examples, leads and associated sense electrodes may be formed in a common lead body with one or more optical fibers, such as a conductor and one or more electrodes placed on a lead sheath that covers an optical fiber. In some examples, an electrical conductor and optical fiber can run axially along the lead, while in another example an electrical conductor may be wound in a coil that runs along the lead while one or more optical fibers extend through the middle of the coil. In other examples, implantable stimulator <b>4</b> may be coupled to one or more leads which may or may not be bifurcated. In such examples, the leads may be coupled to implantable stimulator <b>4</b> via a common lead extension or via separate lead extensions. The sense electrodes may detect various types of bioelectric signals, including local field potentials, energy spectra in different bands, such as alpha, beta, or gamma bands of brain activity, and electrical signals associated with electrocorticography (ECoG) or electroencephalography (EEG). Other sensors may also be included within or on housing <b>14</b> or external to housing <b>14</b> within patient, including an accelerometer or other posture sensor and a pressure sensor. In some examples, in addition to sensing bioelectric signals or as an alternative, the sense electrodes could be selectively used to deliver electrical stimulation, such that the implantable stimulator may deliver optical stimulation and electrical stimulation on, e.g., a selective basis. For example, optical or electrical stimulation could be delivered at different times or at the same time independently of one another or on a coordinated basis.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, implantable stimulator <b>4</b> is implanted within a subcutaneous pocket in a clavicle region of patient <b>6</b>. Optical fibers <b>11</b> may be implanted using a stylet for insertion stiffness while the optical fiber is being implanted in the target tissue. For example, the stylet may allow a surgeon to easily manipulate optical fiber <b>11</b> as it is guided from the clavical region, though the neck, into cranium <b>18</b>, and into brain <b>16</b> of patient. A stylet may also be used to guide optical fibers to other target tissues and other treatments, such as peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), peripheral nerve field stimulation (PNFS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), cortical stimulation (CS), pelvic floor stimulation, gastric stimulation, and the like. The stylet may be removable after insertion of optical fiber <b>11</b> so that the optical fiber <b>11</b> is flexible after insertion such that the stylet does not interfere with chronic treatment by the optical fiber. In one example, optical fiber <b>11</b> or the lead carrying optical fiber <b>11</b> may include a stylet lumen for receiving the stylet and for allow the removal of the stylet.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Stimulator <b>4</b> generates programmable optical stimulation, e.g., optical pulses with selected wavelengths and intensities, and delivers the stimulation via one or more implantable optical fibers <b>11</b>. In some cases, the wavelengths and intensities of the optical pulses may be fixed, or limited to a narrow range. In other examples, the wavelengths and intensities of the optical pulses may be variable, i.e., tunable to produce a wider range of desired wavelengths and intensities. In some cases, multiple sets of one or more implantable optical fibers <b>11</b> may be provided. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, two optical fibers <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B (collectively referred to as &#x201c;optical fibers <b>11</b>&#x201d;) are each carried as part of an optical fiber bundle <b>10</b> until a distal end of bundle <b>10</b> is bifurcated into separate optical fiber segments <b>11</b>. Each optical fiber <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B may be a single optical fiber. Alternatively, in some examples, each optical fiber may include multiple fibers that together deliver optical stimulation. Optical fibers <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B may provide optical transmission between stimulator <b>4</b>, which provides a light source for the optical stimulation, and the area of treatment, shown as the brain <b>16</b> of patient <b>6</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Stimulator <b>4</b> provides optical stimulation by generating optical light <b>15</b> with a desired wavelength and intensity, as described in more detail below, and directing the optical light <b>15</b> into optical fiber <b>11</b> at the proximal end of the optical fiber. The optical light <b>15</b> is transmitted along optical fiber <b>11</b> until it is emitted from a distal end of optical fiber <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Other means of light communication may be used in place of an optical fiber, including a wave guide, a hollow tube, a liquid filled tube, and a light pipe. In an alternative example, a light source, such as a light emitting diode (LED), is implanted at the target treatment site, e.g., at the distal end of a lead or on the housing of a microstimulator device implanted proximate target tissue, such that the light is emitted into the target tissue from the LED, rather than via an optical fiber. In this case, a conducting lead may be implanted to extend from an optical stimulation controller to the LED to conduct electrical energy to power the light source</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Optical stimulation of the target tissue may be configured to cause optogenetic modulation of a selected target population of cells, such as, for example, a particular area of neurons within the brain or spinal cord. The optogenetic modulation may activate light-sensitive channel proteins, referred to herein as &#x201c;opsins,&#x201d; that are expressed within the target population of cells. Opsin expression may be triggered by a biological vector that introduces the opsin to the target neurons. In one example, the biological vector comprises a gene therapy agent, such as a lentivirus or retrovirus that is designed to selectively transfect a particular population of neurons to selectively deliver the genes to the target neurons that will express for the desired opsins. Optogenetic modulation may be particularly useful because the genetic modification provided by biological vectors allow a specific cell population to be targeted and transfected, without modifying neighboring cell populations so that when the area is exposed to stimulation light, only the selected and transfected cell population is actually stimulated. Thus, biological vectors, such as lentiviral-based or retroviral-based vectors, provide for delivery of their genes, allowing for direct cellular targeting through genetic mechanisms as opposed to reliance on electrode positioning. This allows the &#x201c;placement&#x201d; of the therapeutic stimulation to be performed by a highly selective biological vector rather than relying on a surgeon who, no matter how skilled, cannot place an electrode with the same precision. An example of this advantage is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which compares conventional electrical stimulation of neurons, also referred to as galvanic neuromodulation, and optogenetic neuromodulation in a rodent model <b>90</b>. A cross section <b>92</b> of the rodent brain <b>94</b> shows an implanted electrode <b>96</b> and an optical fiber <b>98</b> at a location where target neurons have been transfected. As can be seen on the left portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, electrode <b>96</b> not only activates the target (transfected) neurons <b>100</b>, but also other nearby neurons (normal neurons) <b>102</b>, which are not desired to be activated. In contrast, genetic transfection coupled with optical stimulation, as shown on the right portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, causes only the transfected target neurons <b>100</b> to be activated, while the non-transfected, non-target neurons <b>102</b> remain unactivated.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one example, a first opsin may be used as an activating or exciting opsin that, when exposed to a specific wavelength of light or range of wavelengths, causes the target neuron membrane to become permeable to cations into the neuron, which depolarizes the neuron, also referred to as activating the neuron, and causes a neural spike. A second opsin may be used as an inhibiting opsin that, when exposed to a different wavelength of light or range of wavelengths, acts to hyperpolarize the neuron, also referred to as inhibiting or deactivating the neuron, to counteract the cation permeability of the target neuron. An example of a first opsin is channelrhodopsin-2 that is described in Berndt et al, &#x201c;Bi-stable neural state switches,&#x201d; <i>Nature Neuroscience</i>, vol. 12, pp. 229-34 (2008), U.S. Published Patent Application No. US 2007/0054319 to Boyden et al., U.S. Published Patent Application No. US 2007/0053996 to Boyden et al., and U.S. Published Patent Application No. US 2007/0261127 to Boyden et al., the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties, which is activated to provide a cation-permeable channel that activates the target neuron. For example, the cation-permeable channel may activate the target neuron when exposed to light having a wavelength between about 420 nm and about 500 nm, such as between about 450 nm and about 495 nm, or in one example about 470 nm, and with an intensity of between about 0.5 mW/mm<sup>2 </sup>and about 10 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, such as between about 1 mW/mm<sup>2 </sup>and about 5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, and in one example about 2.4 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>. In one example, a channelrhodopsin-2 opsin is activated by blue light having a wavelength of between about 450 nm and about 495 nm, such as between about 450 nm and about 470 nm. In one example, the channelrhodopsin-2 opsin may only need to be exposed to this light for a pulse of between about 1 ms and about 1 second, such as between 5 ms and about 50 ms, and in one example about 10 ms. The channelrhodopsin-2 opsin holds its activated state and slowly deactivates with a probability window of several seconds. An example channelrhodopsin-2 opsin may also be deactivated or &#x201c;switched off&#x201d; by illumination of a second wavelength of light. In one example, a modified channelrhodopsin-2 may be deactivated by illumination with a green light having a wavelength of between about 495 nm and about 570 nm, such as between about 510 nm and about 550 nm, and in one example about 535 nm, with an intensity of between about 0.5 mW/mm<sup>2 </sup>and about 10 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, such as between about 1 mW/mm<sup>2 </sup>and about 5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, and in one example about 2.4 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, and the channelrhodopsin-2 may be exposed to a pulse of between about 20 ms and about 75 ms, such as between about 40 ms and about 60 ms, and in one example about 50 ms. An example of a second opsin is a halorhodopsin described in Han X. et al., &#x201c;Multiple-Color Optical Activation, Silencing, and Desynchronization of Neural Activity, with Single-Spike Temporal Resolution,&#x201d; PLoS ONE, 2(3):e299, http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000299 (2007), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. This second opsin may be activated to provide an anion pump that inhibits or deactivates the target neuron. In one example, the second opsin is activated, thus deactivating the target neuron, when exposed to yellow light having a wavelength of between about 550 nm and about 610 nm, such as between about 570 nm and about 590 nm, and in one example about 580 nm, and with an intensity of between about 0.5 mW/mm<sup>2 </sup>and about 25 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, such as between about 10 and about 21 mW/mm<sup>2 </sup>in one example or between about 1 mW/mm<sup>2 </sup>and about 5 mW/mm<sup>2 </sup>in another example. In one example, the halorhodopsin may only need to be exposed to this light for between about 10 ms and about 1 second, such as between 20 ms and about 100 ms, and in one example about 40 ms. Not only can halorhodopsin be used to inhibit the firing of the target neurons, but it can also be used to deactivate neurons that were previously activated by the activation of the channelrhodopsin-2 described above. For example, if a 470 nm wavelength light pulse of about 10 ms activates the channelrhodopsin-2, which can remain actives for several seconds, a 535 nm wavelength light pulse may be emitted to deactivate the channelrhodposin-2, and a 580 nm wavelength light pulse may be emitted to activate the halorhodopsin and abruptly deactivate the target neurons. In one example, both the first opsin that activates the target neuron and the second opsin that inhibits the target neuron may be activated simultaneously or substantially simultaneously in order to modulate the threshold potential of the target neuron, such as for the treatment of schizophrenia.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The devices and techniques described in this disclosure may be used in conjunction with any of a variety of opsins or other materials effective in supporting excitation, inhibition or other desired effects on the target tissue. In one example, a first opsin or set of opsins, also referred to as a light-activated cation channel protein (or &#x201c;LACC&#x201d;), comprises the protein, or portions of the protein Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). ChR2 is a rhodopsin derived from the unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. The term &#x201c;rhodopsin&#x201d; as used herein is a protein that comprises at least two building blocks, an opsin protein, and a covalently bound cofactor, usually retinal (retinaldehyde). The rhodopsin ChR2 is derived from the opsin Channelopsin-2 (Chop2) (Nagel, et. al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:13940, and references cited therein). The LACC protein may incorporate retinal that is added to the system, or, depending on the cell type that is used, background levels of retinal present in the cell may produce the required retinal. The use of the term &#x201c;opsin&#x201d; herein is intended to encompass either the opsin or the rhodopsin form of the first opsin and the second opsin. Typically, Chop2 and ChR2 can be interconverted by the addition or removal of the cofactor. Thus, as used herein, a LACC protein comprises an opsin with or without a co-factor. For example, as used herein, where a nucleic acid codes for an opsin protein such as Chop2, it codes for a light activated cation channel protein such as ChR2. Additionally, as used herein, where a cell expresses an opsin protein such as Chop2, it expresses a LACC protein.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The opsins may also cause the modulation of the flow of anions such as chloride across a membrane when activated by light. In one example, a second opsin or set of opsins, also referred to as an anion pump, may comprise the protein, or portions of the protein, halorhodopsin (NpHR). NpHR is a light-driven chloride pump rhodopsin derived from the unicellular archaeon <i>Natronomonas pharaonis</i>. Optically induced electrical and chemical changes due to activation of the opsins by light are also contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some examples, it may desirable to add cofactor (usually in the nanomolar to micromolar range). In other examples, no addition of retinal is required. In some examples, the medium may provide the required cofactor. In one example, the opsin protein covalently binds retinal. The term retinal, as used in comprises all-trans retinal, 11-cis retinal, and other isomers of retinal.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some examples, the protein Bcdo can be expressed along with ChR2. Bcdo converts the common dietary molecule beta carotene into retinal (Yan et. al., Genomics 72 (2): 193 (2001)), thus providing retinal to convert Chop2 to ChR2.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;ChR2,&#x201d; &#x201c;Chop2,&#x201d; and &#x201c;NpHR&#x201d; mean the full proteins or fragments thereof. In one example, the LACC comprises the amino terminal 310 amino acids of Chop2 which is referred to herein as Chop2-310. One example comprises the amino terminal 310 amino acids of ChR2 which is referred to as ChR2-310. The amino-terminal 310 amino acids of ChR2 show homology to the 7-transmembrane structure of many microbial-type rhodopsins, and comprise a channel with a light-gated conductance. In an example, a LACC protein comprises a 7-transmembrane protein. Preferably the LACC protein is a 7-transmembrane protein that either has a binding affinity for retinal, or has retinal bound to it.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one example, the LACC is derived from a microbial-type rhodopsin. In one example, the LACC of the present invention is derived from a bacteriorhodopsin.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one example, each opsin is a single-component protein that is an opsin protein. As used herein, a single component protein is a single covalently linked chain of amino acids. Multiple component systems require communication between non-covalently linked molecules, which can be much slower than within-protein signaling via conformational changes. The opsin allows the creation of light-gated membrane conductance with a single protein component. While not being bound by theory, it is believed that the retinal in ChR2, as a microbial type rhodopsin, is strongly bound, allowing the retinal to re-isomerize to the all-trans ground state in a dark reaction without the need for other enzymes. This mechanism allows for fast recovery (closing of the ionic channel) when the light is removed, and it obviates the need for other enzyme components for re-generation of the all trans-retinal and closing of the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one example, the light-activated cation-channel Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is genetically introduced into a cellular membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The LACC protein may also comprise the protein sequence of Chop2-310 [SEQ ID NO:1]. The anion pump protein may comprise the protein sequence of NpHR [SEQ ID NO:4]. &#x201c;Protein&#x201d; in this sense includes proteins, polypeptides, and peptides. Also included within the opsin protein are amino acid variants of the naturally occurring sequences, as determined herein. In one example, the variants are greater than about 75% homologous to the protein sequence of Chop2 or Chop2-310, such as greater than about 80%, for example greater than about 85%, such as greater than about 90%. In some examples, the homology will be as high as about 93 to about 95 or about 98%. In one example, the variants are greater than about 75% homologous to the protein sequence of NpHR, such as greater than about 80%, for example greater than about 85%, such as greater than 90%. In some examples, the homology will be as high as about 93 to about 95 or about 98%. Homology in this context means sequence similarity or identity, with identity being preferred. This homology will be determined using standard techniques known in the art. The compositions of the opsins include the protein and nucleic acid sequences provided herein including variants which are more than about 50% homologous to the provided sequence, more than about 55% homologous to the provided sequence, more than about 60% homologous to the provided sequence, more than about 65% homologous to the provided sequence, more than about 70% homologous to the provided sequence, more than about 75% homologous to the provided sequence, more than about 80% homologous to the provided sequence, more than about 85% homologous to the provided sequence, more than about 90% homologous to the provided sequence, or more than about 95% homologous to the provided sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The LACC proteins may be shorter or longer than the protein sequence of Chop2 or Chop2-310. Thus, in one example, included within the definition of LACC proteins are portions or fragments of the protein sequence of Chop2 or of Chop2-310. The anion pump proteins may be shorter or longer than the protein sequence for NpHR. Thus, in one example, included within the definition of anion pump proteins are portions or fragments of the protein sequence of NpHR. In addition, nucleic acids may be used to obtain additional coding regions, and thus additional protein sequence, using techniques known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one example, the LACC proteins are derivative or variant protein sequences, as compared to Chop2 or Chop2-310. In one example, the anion pump proteins are derivative or variant protein sequences as compared to NpHR. That is, the derivative LACC proteins or derivative anion pump proteins may contain at least one amino acid substitution, deletion or insertion, with amino acid substitutions being particularly preferred. The amino acid substitution, insertion or deletion may occur at any residue within the LACC protein or the anion pump protein.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one example, the LACC proteins are amino acid sequence variants of the ChR2, Chop2, ChR2-310, Chop-310 or [SEQ ID NO:1]. In another example, the anion pump proteins are amino acid sequence variants of NpHR. These variants fall into one or more of three classes: substitutional, insertional or deletional variants. These variants ordinarily are prepared by site specific mutagenesis of nucleotides in the DNA encoding the LACC proteins or anion pump proteins, using cassette or PCR mutagenesis or other techniques well known in the art, to produce DNA encoding the variant, and thereafter expressing the DNA in recombinant cell culture. Amino acid sequence variants are characterized by the predetermined nature of the variation, a feature that sets them apart from naturally occurring allelic or interspecies variation of the LACC proteins or anion pump proteins. The variants typically exhibit the same qualitative biological activity as the naturally occurring analogue, although variants can also be selected which have modified characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">While the site or region for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, in order to optimize the performance of a mutation at a given site, random mutagenesis may be conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed breast cancer variants screened for the optimal combination of desired activity. Techniques for making substitution mutations at predetermined sites in DNA having a known sequence are well known, for example, M13 primer mutagenesis and PCR mutagenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Amino acid substitutions are typically of single residues; insertions usually will be on the order of from about 1 to 20 amino acids, although considerably larger insertions may be tolerated. Deletions range from about 1 to about 20 residues, although in some cases deletions may be much larger.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Substitutions, deletions, insertions or any combination thereof may be used to arrive at a final derivative. Generally these changes are done on a few amino acids to minimize the alteration of the molecule. However, larger changes may be tolerated in certain circumstances. In some examples, small alterations in the characteristics of the LACC proteins or anion pump proteins are desired, substitutions are generally made in accordance with Table 1:</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Substantial changes in function are made by selecting substitutions that are less conservative than those shown in Table 1. For example, substitutions may be made which more significantly affect the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the alteration, for example the alpha-helical or beta-sheet structure; the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site; or the bulk of the side chain. The substitutions which in general are expected to produce the greatest changes in the polypeptide's properties are those in which (a) a hydrophilic residue, e.g. seryl or threonyl is substituted for (or by) a hydrophobic residue, e.g. leucyl, isoleucyl, phenylalanyl, valyl or alanyl; (b) a cysteine or proline is substituted for (or by) any other residue; (c) a residue having an electropositive side chain, e.g. lysyl, arginyl, or histidyl, is substituted for (or by) an electronegative residue, e.g. glutamyl or aspartyl; or (d) a residue having a bulky side chain, e.g. phenylalanine, is substituted for (or by) one not having a side chain, e.g. glycine.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The variants or derivatives of the LACC proteins typically exhibit the same qualitative activity as the Chop2, ChR2, Chop-310, or ChR2-310 protein, while variants or derivatives of the anion pump proteins typically exhibit the same qualitative activity as NpHR, although variants or derivatives also are selected to modify the characteristics of the opsins as needed. Variants or derivatives can show enhanced ion selectivity, stability, speed, compatibility, and reduced toxicity. For example, the protein can be modified such that it can be driven by a different wavelength of light than the wavelength of around 460 nm of the wild type ChR2 protein. The protein can be modified, for example, such that it can be driven at a higher wavelength such as about 480 nm, 490 nm, 500 nm, 510 nm, 520 nm, 530 nm, 540 nm, 550 nm, 560 nm, 570 nm, 580 nm, or 590 nm. Similarly, the anion pump protein can be modified such that it can be driven by a different wavelength of light than the 580 nm of the wild type NpHR.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The opsins may incorporate un-natural amino acids as well as natural amino acids. The unnatural amino acids can be used to enhance ion selectivity, stability, speed, compatibility, or to lower toxicity.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one example, the opsins may comprise a fusion protein comprising a light-activated channel protein, such as a LACC protein or anion pump protein described above. It is well known in the art that fusion proteins can be made that will create a single protein with the combined activities of several proteins. In one example, the fusion proteins can be used to target Chop2, ChR2, or NpHR to specific cells or regions within cells.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one example, a fusion protein comprising a LACC protein or anion pump protein is a fusion protein that targets sub-cellular regions of the cell. The fusion proteins may target, for instance, axons, dendrites, and synapses of neurons. In one example, a PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg and ZO-1) domain is fused to ChR2 or Chop2 which target dendrites. In another example, Axon initial segment (AIS) domain is fused to ChR2 or Chop2 which target axons.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Other fusion proteins may be used, such as are proteins combining an opsin and a fluorescent protein in order to allow for monitoring of the localization of the opsin. Example fusion proteins are those with red fluorescent protein (mCherry), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), green fluorescent protein (GFP), and woodchuck hepatitis post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE). These fusion proteins, such as a ChR2-mCherrry fusion protein or a NpHr-EYFP or NpHR-EYFP-WPRE fusion protein, allow for the independent stimulation of ChR2 or NpHR and the simultaneous monitoring of localization. The simultaneous stimulation and monitoring of localization can be carried out in many cell types including mammalian systems.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one example, an opsin protein is provided that is non-toxic in the cells in which it is expressed. In one example, the opsin proteins do not perturb the basal electrical properties, alter the dynamic electrical properties, or jeopardize the prospects for cellular survival. In one example, the opsin proteins do not alter the membrane resistance of the cells in the absence of light. In one example, the opsin proteins do not lead to apoptosis in the cells, nor lead to the generation of pyknotic nuclei. In one example, in the absence of light, the presence of the opsin proteins do not alter cell health or ongoing electrical activity, at the level of subthreshold changes in voltage or in spike output, either by shunting current through leaky channels or by altering the voltage dependence of existing neuronal input-output relationships. In one example, the presence of opsin protein creates no significant long-term plastic or homeostatic alterations in the electrical properties of neurons expressing the protein.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">It would be understood by a person of skill in the art that the opsin proteins can be coded for by various nucleic acids. Each amino acid in the protein is represented by one or more sets of 3 nucleic acids (codons). Since many amino acids are represented by more than one codon, there is not a unique nucleic acid sequence that codes for a given protein. It is well understood by persons of skill in the art how to make a nucleic acid that can code for the opsin proteins by knowing the amino acid sequence of the protein. A nucleic acid sequence that codes for a polypeptide or protein is the &#x201c;gene&#x201d; of that polypeptide or protein. A gene can be RNA, DNA, or other nucleic acid than will code for the polypeptide or protein. An example nucleic acid sequence for coding for a LACC comprises SEQ ID NO:2. An example nucleic acid sequence for coding for an anion pump protein comprises SEQ ID NO:5.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It is known by persons of skill in the art that the codon systems in different organisms can be slightly different, and that therefore where the expression of a given protein from a given organism is desired, the nucleic acid sequence can be modified for expression within that organism.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one example, the nucleic acid sequence codes for an opsin protein that is optimized for expression with a mammalian cell. A preferred embodiment comprises a nucleic acid sequence optimized for expression in a human cell. In one example, a nucleic acid sequence that codes for a light-activated cation protein that is optimized for expression with a human cell comprises SEQ ID NO:3. In one example, a nucleic acid sequence that codes for an anion pump protein that is optimized for expression with a mammalian cell comprises SEQ ID NO:5.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one example, reagents are provided for genetically targeted expression of the opsin proteins including ChR2 and NpHR. Genetic targeting may be used to deliver opsin proteins to specific cell types, to specific cell subtypes, to specific spatial regions within an organism, and to sub-cellular regions within a cell. Genetic targeting also relates to the control of the amount of opsin protein expressed, and the timing of the expression.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one example, a reagent for genetically targeted expression of the opsin protein comprises a vector which contains the gene for the opsin protein. As used herein, the term &#x201c;vector&#x201d; refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting between different genetic environments another nucleic acid to which it has been operatively linked. The term &#x201c;vector&#x201d; also refers to a virus or organism that is capable of transporting the nucleic acid molecule. One example vector is an episome, such as a nucleic acid molecule capable of extra-chromosomal replication. Example vectors are those capable of autonomous replication and/or expression of nucleic acids to which they are linked. Vectors capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked are referred to herein as &#x201c;expression vectors&#x201d;. Other example vectors are viruses such as lentiviruses, retroviruses, adenoviruses and phages. In some examples, vectors may genetically insert opsin proteins into both dividing and non-dividing cells. Example vectors can genetically insert opsin proteins in-vivo or in-vitro.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Those vectors that include a prokaryotic replicon may also include a prokaryotic promoter capable of directing the expression (transcription and translation) of the opsin protein in a bacterial host cell, such as <i>E. coli</i>. A promoter is an expression control element formed by a DNA sequence that permits binding of RNA polymerase and transcription to occur. Promoter sequences compatible with bacterial hosts are typically provided in plasmid vectors containing convenience restriction sites for insertion of a DNA segment of the present invention. Examples of such vector plasmids are pUC8, pUC9, pBR322, and pBR329 available from BioRad Laboratories, (Richmond, Calif.) and pPL and pKK223 available from Pharmacia, (Piscataway, N.J.).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Expression vectors compatible with eukaryotic cells, may also be used. Eukaryotic cell expression vectors are well known in the art and are available from several commercial sources. Such vectors may be provided containing convenient restriction sites for insertion of the desired DNA homologue. Examples of such vectors are pKSV-10 (Pharmacia), pBPV-1/PML2d (International Biotechnologies, Inc.), and pTDT1 (ATCC, No. 31255).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">One example of an expression vector is a lentivirus comprising the gene for ChR2 or Chop2 and an EF1-alpha promoter. This lentivirus vector may be used to create stable cell lines. The term &#x201c;cell line&#x201d; as used herein is an established cell culture that will continue to proliferate given the appropriate medium.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In one example, an expression vector is a lentivirus comprising the gene for the opsin and a cell specific promoter. Examples of cell specific promoters are promoters for somatostatin, parvalbumin, GABA&#x3b1;6, L7, and calbindin. Other example cell specific promoters are promoters for kinases such as PKC, PKA, and CaMKII; promoters for other ligand receptors such as NMDAR1, NMDAR2B, G1uR2; promoters for ion channels including calcium channels, potassium channels, chloride channels, and sodium channels; and promoters for other markers that label classical mature and dividing cell types, such as calretinin, nestin, and beta3-tubulin.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Another example is a lentivirus containing tetracycline elements that allow control of the gene expression levels of ChR2 or NpHR, simply by altering levels of exogenous drugs such as doxycycline. This method, or other methods that place ChR2 or NpHR under the control of a drug-dependent promoter, will enable control of the dosage of ChR2 NpHR in cells, allowing a given amount of light to have different effects on electrical activation, substance release, or cellular development.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Nucleic acid sequences comprising the gene for opsin proteins and promoters for genetically targeted expression of the proteins may also be provided. The genetically targeted expression of the opsin proteins can be facilitated by the selection of promoters. The term &#x201c;promoter&#x201d; as used herein is nucleic acid sequence that enables a specific gene to be transcribed. The promoter may reside near a region of DNA to be transcribed. The promoter is usually recognized by an RNA polymerase, which, under the control of the promoter, creates RNA, which is then converted into the protein for which it codes. By use of the appropriate promoter, the level of expression of opsin protein can be controlled. Cells use promoters to control where, when, and how much of a specific protein is expressed. Therefore, by selecting a promoter that is selectively expressed predominantly within one type of cell, one subtype of cells, a given spatial region within an organism, or sub-cellular region within a cell, the expression of an opsin protein can be controlled accordingly. The use of promoters also allows the control of the amount of LACC expressed, and the timing of the expression. The promoters can be prokaryotic or eukaryotic promoters.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one example, a nucleic acid sequence comprises the gene for an opsin protein and a general purpose promoter. A general purpose promoter allows expression of the opsin protein in a wide variety of cell types. One example of a general purpose promoter is the EF1-alpha promoter. The EF-1 alpha gene encodes for elongation factor-1 alpha which is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells and is expressed in almost all kinds of mammalian cells. The promoter of this &#x201c;housekeeping&#x201d; gene can lead to persistent expression of the transgene in vivo. Another example promoter is the CMV (cytomegalovirus) promoter, which can drive gene expression at very high levels. Still other example general-purpose promoters include those for CaMKII and synapsin I (Dittgen et. al, PNAS 101:18206-11 (2004)).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In one example, a nucleic acid sequence comprising the gene for an opsin protein and a cell specific promoter is provided. Examples of cell specific promoters are promoters for somatostatin, parvalbumin, GABA&#x3b1;6, L7, and calbindin. Other example cell specific promoters are promoters for kinases such as PKC, PKA, and CaMKII; promoters for other ligand receptors such as NMDAR1, NMDAR2B, G1uR2; promoters for ion channels including calcium channels, potassium channels, chloride channels, and sodium channels; and promoters for other markers that label classical mature and dividing cell types, such as calretinin, nestin, and beta3-tubulin. In one example, the nucleic acid comprises a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In one example, a promoter is an inducible promoter. For instance, the promoter may be inducible by a trans-acting factor which responds to an exogenously administered drug. The promoters may be, but are not limited to tetracycline-on or tetracycline-off, or tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In another example, a first opsin or set of opsins may be designed to activate a first population of cells upon exposure to a first wavelength of light or range of wavelengths, while a second opsin or set of opsins may be designed to inhibit a second population of cells upon exposure to the same wavelength or range of wavelengths of light, allowing for even more targeted control of the overall bioelectrical response of the target tissue or tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Optical fibers <b>11</b> may be made from a plastic or glass, and as such may provide advantages over the leads and electrodes use for conventional electrical stimulation. First, because optical fibers <b>11</b> are not electrically conducting, they do not provide a galvanic path for induced currents at the tissue interface so there is no risk of tissue capture or excessive heating that can occur due to modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or electromagnetic interference (EMI). Moreover, the elimination of conductors from the tissue interface helps to mitigate MRI interference that is seen with typical electrical stimulation electrodes, allowing for continued high-resolution imaging post-implant. Second, because there is not a relatively large electrical current flowing through the target tissue, as is the case with electrical stimulation, optical stimulation does not mask or block the relatively smaller bioelectric activity that is electrically sensed at the same time optical stimulation is delivered. Thus, optical stimulation allows for simultaneous electrical sensing of the resulting reaction by the target tissue, allowing system <b>2</b> to provide for closed-loop feedback and control of the optical stimulation.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The architecture of an example implantable optogenetic neuromodulation system <b>110</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. System <b>110</b> may comprise a hermetically-sealed chronic optical delivery system. System <b>110</b> may include an optical fiber <b>11</b> for light delivery, a fiber feedthrough <b>112</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, that couples optical fiber <b>11</b> to a light source <b>63</b> optically connected, or &#x201c;pigtailed&#x201d; to optical fiber <b>11</b>, and provides a hermetic barrier between stimulator <b>114</b> and the tissue, an optical stimulation circuit <b>116</b> for driving light source <b>63</b>, a microcontroller <b>118</b>, also referred to as a processor, to manage system <b>110</b>, a power source, such as a rechargeable battery <b>122</b>, and an RF-power conditioning module <b>120</b> for bidirectional data communication and, if desired, recharging of the rechargeable battery <b>122</b>. In one example, system <b>110</b> may include a temperature sensor <b>124</b> for use in implementing a closed-loop system to manage power flow in implant <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Examples of light source <b>63</b> that may be used in system <b>110</b> include one or more light-emitting diodes LEDs and one or more lasers. In one example, light source <b>63</b> may include one light source for activation of the target tissue, such as a light source to activate a channelrhodopsin-2 opsin, and another light source to inhibit the target tissue, such as a light source to activate a halorhodopsin opsin. Light source <b>63</b> may also include a light source to stop the activation of the target tissue, but not necessarily to inhibit the target tissue, such as a light source that deactivates or &#x201c;switches off&#x201d; the channelrhodopsin-2 opsin. In one example, light source <b>63</b> may comprise a standard commercially available LED tuned to a blue light wavelength of between about 459 nm and about 469 nm with an output power of between about 3.5 mW and about 5.5 mW for the activation of channelrhodopsin-2, a standard commercially available LED tuned to a green light wavelength of between about 515 nm and about 540 nm with an output power of between about 0.02 mW and about 1.5 mW for the deactivation of channelrhodopsin-2, and a standard commercially available LED tuned to a yellow light wavelength of about 558 nm with a power output of between about 0.02 mW and about 0.025 mW for activation of the halorhodopsin. In another example, light source <b>63</b> is one or more lasers that provide the optical stimulation to the target tissue. In one example, light source <b>63</b> may comprise a blue laser for the activation of channelrhodopsin-2, such as a standard commercially available semiconductor laser having a wavelength of about 470 nm with an output power of about 7.24 mW and a yellow laser for the activation of halorhodopsin, such as a standard commercially available semiconductor laser having a wavelength of about 532 nm with an output power of about 12 mW. If a battery power source is used, choice of the appropriate battery will depend on voltage, power and capacity/longevity needs that will depend on light source, circuitry and telemetry choices.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The system <b>110</b> may also include a charge pump <b>126</b> to convert the voltage of battery <b>122</b> to a voltage level appropriate to drive light source <b>63</b>, and, in some examples, to convert the battery voltage to other voltage levels appropriate for other functions. The charge pump <b>126</b> may be tuned from 2&#xd7; to 5&#xd7; to accommodate power source voltage variation, such as battery voltage variation for a battery power source in the case of a primary battery or a rechargeable battery. In other words, charge pump <b>126</b> may be configured to provide different conversion ratios depending on the voltage level of the battery <b>122</b> over time as the battery discharges. Charge pump <b>126</b> may be a capacitive charge pump or an inductive charge pump, depending on the energy requirements of light source <b>63</b>. For example, if light source <b>63</b> has a large power requirement, such as with a laser light source described in more detail below, than an inductive charge pump may be used because it is better at delivering higher power. Conversely, if light source <b>63</b> has low power requirements, such as with some low power light-emitting diodes (LEDs), then a capacitive charge pump may be used because it does not require the use of a bulky induction coil. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, system <b>110</b> includes a rechargeable battery source <b>122</b> to power light source <b>63</b>, which may be an LED-based light source, or possibly a higher voltage laser device.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In another example, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, instead of a fiber feedthrough, an optical stimulation device <b>160</b> may comprise a window <b>162</b> formed in housing <b>164</b> of implantable stimulator <b>160</b>, such as by hermetically sealing window <b>162</b> in stimulator housing <b>164</b>. Hermetically-sealed window <b>162</b> may be optically connected to an optical light guide, such as optical fiber <b>11</b>. Window <b>162</b> may also be optically connected to the output of a light source, such as an LED <b>166</b>, within housing <b>164</b>. The optical connection <b>168</b> between window <b>162</b> and LED <b>166</b> is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In one example, the optical connection between window <b>162</b> and optical fiber <b>11</b> is achieved through an optical index matching gel <b>170</b> applied to window <b>162</b>. Index matching gel <b>170</b> ensures that the light produced by LED <b>166</b> maintains the desired wavelength, e.g. an excitation wavelength or inhibition wavelength corresponding to the light-sensitive channel protein at the target tissue, as described above. In this example, there is no need to have a feedthrough. Rather, the light from the light source <b>166</b> is delivered through window <b>162</b> to a proximal end <b>172</b> of the optically-connected optical fiber <b>11</b>, such as through the index matching gel <b>170</b>. This approach may provide more flexibility in terms of coupling the light source stimulation site because the window can be selected and configured to form part of the focusing optics for the light transmitted into the optical fiber.

In another example, one or more optical fibers <b>11</b> and one or more conducting leads <b>12</b> may be carried together as a unitary lead that contains both the one or more optical fibers <b>11</b> and the conducting lead <b>12</b>. In one example, a unitary lead may contain both an optical fiber and a conducting lead, wherein sense electrodes are placed on a lead sheath that covers the optical fiber. In this example, the electrical conductors could be axial, running along the length of the lead with the optical fiber extending alongside the electrical conductor, or with the optical fiber being wound in a coil around the one or more electrical conductors, or with the electrical conductor being embedded within the optical fiber. In another example, the one or more electrical conductors may be wound in a coil, with the optical fiber extending inside the center of the coil, or with the optical fiber wound in a generally coaxial coil. In another example, rather than optical fibers, system <b>2</b> may include a lead that carries one or more electrical conductors that provide power to one or more light sources, such as an LED or a laser, located at the distal end of the lead.

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, implantable stimulator <b>4</b> may deliver, for example, deep brain stimulation (DBS) or cortical stimulation (CS) therapy to patient <b>6</b> via the optical fibers <b>11</b> to treat any of a variety of neurological disorders or diseases. Example neurological disorders may include depression, dementia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, spasticity, epilepsy, and dystonia. DBS also may be useful for treating other patient conditions, such as migraines and obesity. However, the disclosure is not limited to the configuration of fiber bundle <b>10</b> or optical fibers <b>11</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or to the delivery of DBS or CS therapy.</p>

In the case of migraines, optical fibers <b>11</b> may be implanted to provide stimulation to the visual cortex of brain <b>16</b> in order to reduce or eliminate migraine headaches afflicting patient <b>6</b>. However, the target therapy delivery site may depend upon the patient condition or disorder being treated.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The sense electrodes <b>17</b> of lead segments <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B are shown as ring electrodes. Ring electrodes are commonly used in DBS applications because they are simple to program and are capable of sensing an electrical field to any tissue proximate to lead segments <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B. In other implementations, sense electrodes <b>17</b> of lead segments <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B may have different configurations.

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Therapy system <b>2</b> also may include a clinician programmer <b>20</b> and/or a patient programmer <b>22</b>. Clinician programmer <b>20</b> may be a handheld computing device that permits a clinician to program stimulation therapy for patient <b>6</b> via a user interface, e.g., using input keys and a display. For example, using clinician programmer <b>20</b>, the clinician may specify stimulation parameters, i.e., create programs, for use in delivery of stimulation therapy. Clinician programmer <b>20</b> may support telemetry (e.g., radio frequency (RF) telemetry) with implantable stimulator <b>4</b> to download programs and, optionally, upload operational or physiological data stored by implantable stimulator <b>4</b>. In this manner, the clinician may periodically interrogate implantable stimulator <b>4</b> to evaluate efficacy and, if necessary, modify the programs or create new programs. In some examples, clinician programmer <b>20</b> transmits programs to patient programmer <b>22</b> in addition to or instead of implantable stimulator <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Like clinician programmer <b>20</b>, patient programmer <b>22</b> may be a handheld computing device. Patient programmer <b>22</b> may also include a display and input keys to allow patient <b>6</b> to interact with patient programmer <b>22</b> and implantable stimulator <b>4</b>. In this manner, patient programmer <b>22</b> provides patient <b>6</b> with a user interface for control of the stimulation therapy delivered by implantable stimulator <b>4</b>. For example, patient <b>6</b> may use patient programmer <b>22</b> to start, stop or adjust optical stimulation therapy. In particular, patient programmer <b>22</b> may permit patient <b>6</b> to adjust stimulation parameters of a program such as duration of treatment, optical intensity or amplitude, pulse width, pulse frequency, burst length, and burst rate. Patient <b>6</b> may also select a program, e.g., from among a plurality of stored programs, as the present program to control delivery of stimulation by implantable stimulator <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some examples, implantable stimulator <b>4</b> delivers stimulation according to a group of programs at a given time. Each program of such a program group may include respective values for each of a plurality of therapy parameters, such as respective values for each of optical intensity or amplitude, pulse width, pulse shape, pulse rate, burst frequency, burst rate, burst width, and optical fiber configuration (e.g., the combination of optical fibers used and with what light intensity and wavelengths). Implantable stimulator <b>4</b> may interleave pulses or other signals according to the different programs of a program group, e.g., cycle through the programs, to simultaneously treat different symptoms or different body regions, or provide a combined therapeutic effect. In such examples, clinician programmer <b>20</b> may be used to create programs, and assemble the programs into program groups. Patient programmer <b>22</b> may be used to adjust stimulation parameters of one or more programs of a program group, and select a program group, e.g., from among a plurality of stored program groups, as the current program group to control delivery of stimulation by implantable stimulator <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Implantable stimulator <b>4</b>, clinician programmer <b>20</b>, and patient programmer <b>22</b> may communicate via cables or a wireless communication, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.

<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating system <b>30</b> that delivers stimulation therapy to spinal cord <b>38</b> of patient <b>36</b>, also known as spinal cord stimulation (SCS). Other stimulation systems may be configured to deliver electrical stimulation to gastrointestinal organs, pelvic nerves or muscle, peripheral nerves, or other stimulation sites. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, system <b>30</b> delivers optical stimulation therapy from implantable stimulator <b>34</b> to spinal cord <b>38</b> via one or more optical fibers <b>32</b>A and <b>32</b>B (collectively &#x201c;optical fibers <b>32</b>&#x201d;). System <b>30</b> and, more particularly, implantable stimulator <b>34</b> may operate in a manner similar to implantable stimulator <b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). That is, in one example, implantable stimulator <b>34</b> delivers controlled optical stimulation pulses or waveforms to patient <b>36</b> via one or more regulated stimulation optical fibers <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the distal ends of optical fibers <b>32</b> are placed adjacent to the target tissue of spinal cord <b>38</b> such that light is emitted from the distal ends into the target tissue. The proximal ends of optical fibers <b>32</b> may be both optically and mechanically coupled to implantable stimulator <b>34</b> either directly or indirectly via a fiber extension and header. Alternatively, in some examples, optical fibers <b>32</b> may be implanted and coupled to an external stimulator, e.g., through a percutaneous port.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Stimulator <b>34</b> may be implanted in patient <b>36</b> at a location minimally noticeable to the patient. For SCS, stimulator <b>34</b> may be located in the lower abdomen, lower back, buttock or other location to secure the stimulator. Optical fibers <b>32</b> are tunneled from stimulator <b>34</b> through tissue to reach the target tissue adjacent to spinal cord <b>38</b> for optical stimulation delivery. Light is directed through optical fibers <b>32</b> so that the light is emitted from the distal ends of leads <b>32</b> in order to provide optical stimulation pulses from each optical fiber <b>32</b> to the target tissue. The stimulation pulses may be delivered using various optical fiber arrangements such as the use of a single optical fiber <b>32</b> to stimulate the target tissue or multiple optical fibers <b>32</b> arranged in a particular pattern around the target tissue. In one example, optical fibers <b>32</b> run along the spinal cord and shine light generally perpendicular to the axis of the spinal column. In one example, optical fibers <b>32</b> are anchored within or along the spinal column, such as with stereotactic techniques, to precisely position optical fibers <b>32</b> to provide the desired directionality of light emitted from optical fibers <b>32</b> and to prevent migration of optical fibers <b>32</b> after implantation. Anchoring of optical fibers <b>32</b> may prevent migration of optical fibers <b>32</b> during use and may also allow optical fibers <b>32</b> to be subjected to controlled bends to prevent light leakage from the optical fibers <b>32</b>. In another example, optical fibers <b>32</b> allow for sharp angles within the small dimensions of the target tissue, such as in brain <b>16</b> or spinal cord <b>38</b>. In another example, optical fibers are not used, but rather the light source is implanted at the target tissue at the end of an electrode, such as implanting a wire that extends from the stimulator <b>34</b> to the target tissue to power an LED to expose the target tissue to light. In another example, an LED is carried on the housing of a device that is implanted proximate the target tissue to expose the target tissue to light, while the device, such as a microstimulator device, may be connected to an implantable stimulator that is connected to the device by a wire. In still another example, an LED within the device housing may deliver light through a window in the device to target tissue proximate the window.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Implantable stimulator <b>34</b> delivers stimulation to spinal cord <b>38</b> to reduce the amount of pain perceived by patient <b>36</b>. As mentioned above, however, the stimulator may be used with a variety of different therapies, such as peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), peripheral nerve field stimulation (PNFS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), cortical stimulation (CS), pelvic floor stimulation, gastric stimulation, and the like. The stimulation delivered by implantable stimulator <b>34</b> may take the form of optical stimulation pulses or bursts, and may be characterized by controlled light intensity, as well as programmed pulse widths and pulse rates in the case of stimulation current pulses or controlled burst widths, burst frequencies, and burst rates for optical stimulation bursts. Stimulation may be delivered via selected combinations of optical fibers emitting light at multiple locations along the target tissue or at multiple target tissues. Stimulation of spinal cord <b>38</b> may, for example, prevent pain signals from traveling through the spinal cord and to the brain of the patient. Patient <b>36</b> perceives the interruption of pain signals as a reduction in pain and, therefore, efficacious therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a user, such as a clinician or patient <b>36</b>, may interact with a user interface of external programmer <b>40</b> to program stimulator <b>34</b>. Programming of stimulator <b>34</b> may refer generally to the generation and transfer of commands, programs, or other information to control the operation of the stimulator. For example, programmer <b>40</b> may transmit programs, parameter adjustments, program selections, group selections, or other information to control the operation of stimulator <b>34</b>, e.g., by wireless telemetry. In accordance with this disclosure, programmer <b>40</b> may transmit to the stimulator <b>34</b> information regarding the patient and regarding therapy the patient received during previous sessions including, for example, images that show placement of optical fibers <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In some cases, external programmer <b>40</b> may be characterized as a physician or clinician programmer, such as clinician programmer <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), if it is primarily intended for use by a physician or clinician.

In general, a physician or clinician programmer may support selection and generation of programs by a clinician for use by stimulator <b>34</b>, whereas a patient programmer may support adjustment and selection of such programs by a patient during ordinary use.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Whether programmer <b>40</b> is configured for clinician or patient use, programmer <b>40</b> may communicate to implantable stimulator <b>34</b> or any other computing device via wireless communication.

Programmer <b>40</b> may also communicate with another programming or computing device via exchange of removable media, such as magnetic or optical disks, or memory cards or sticks. Further, programmer <b>40</b> may communicate with implantable stimulator <b>34</b> and other programming devices via remote telemetry techniques known in the art, communicating via a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), public switched telephone network (PSTN), or cellular telephone network, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Programming of stimulator <b>34</b> may also include graphically defining a desired stimulation field(s) within zones in one or more target tissues adjacent to the distal ends of one or more optical fibers <b>32</b>, and generating, via a programmer, the optical stimulation required to create the stimulation field. Programming of stimulator <b>34</b> may also include translating one or more user input stimulation zones into a set of optical fibers <b>32</b> for delivering optical stimulation therapy to a patient, and a set of parameters such as pulse amplitudes, pulse widths, and pulse frequency associated with such optical fibers <b>32</b>. Programming may further include manipulating the shape and position of the zone, including behaviors of the zone while moving and when colliding with other zones or system interlocks. As the stimulation zone is sized, moved, or shaped, the programmer may automatically compute updated optical fiber selections and parameters for delivery of stimulation indicated by the stimulation zone.</p>

In another example, a set of one or more optical fibers or fiber bundles may be provided to a first target tissue site while a second set of one or more optical fibers or fiber bundles may be provided to a second target tissue site. For example, a set of one or more optical fibers or fiber bundles may be directed to the subthalmic nucleus while another set of one or more optical fibers or fiber bundles may be directed to the pedunculopontine nucleus such that the combined use of the two sets of optical fibers may provide closed-loop deep brain stimulation to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, spasticity, epilepsy, and dystonia. In some cases, bioelectric signals may be sensed by the implanted device to detect onset of seizure, movement disorder symptoms, or other conditions, and trigger stimulation to alleviate such symptoms. As an additional example, the optogenetic stimulation may be applied to support a cell-targeted treatment for schizophrenia. In another example, two or more sets of optical fibers or optical fiber bundles may be placed at various epileptic foci and used for distributed treatment of the epileptic foci.

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> is optically coupled to optical fibers <b>48</b>A-<b>48</b>D. Optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> may include stimulation generation circuitry to generate stimulation pulses and circuitry for switching stimulation across different optical fiber combinations, e.g., in response to control by processor <b>50</b>. Optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> produces an optical stimulation signal in accordance with a program based on control signals from processor <b>50</b>. Optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> may also include one or more light sources <b>63</b>, such as one or more lasers or one or more light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that produce optical light within stimulator <b>34</b> that is then transmitted along optical fibers <b>48</b> to provide optical stimulation treatment to a target tissue. Alternatively, light source <b>63</b> may be separate from optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> such that optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> provides the signal that powers light source <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As described above, stimulator <b>34</b> delivers optical stimulation to the target neurons to activate one or more opsins that have been expressed in the target neurons. In one example, as described above, a first opsin is activated by a first wavelength of light so that the target neurons become permeable to cations to initiate neuronal spikes and fire the target neuron and a second opsin is activated by a second wavelength of light to deactivate or inhibit the target neurons. In this example, stimulator <b>34</b> may provide for a useful chronic device enabling continuous therapy by providing light at both the first wavelength and the second wavelength on an alternating or selective basis in order to provide for both selective activation and inhibition of the target neurons. For example, if chanelrhodopsin-2 is used as the activation opsin and halorhodopsin is used as the inhibition opsin, then optical stimulation generator <b>60</b>, and particularly light source <b>63</b>, may be configured to provide a first wavelength of between about 420 nm and about 475 nm, such as about 450 nm, to activate the channelrhodopsin-2 and activate the target neurons and a second wavelength of between about 510 nm and about 580 nm, such as about 535 nm, to activate the halorhodopsin and inhibit the target neurons. In another example, optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> may be configured to mimic more classical stimulation paradigms, such as by activating the standard, wild-type, channelrhodopsin-2 channel that acts as a light-activated transconductor, wherein the standard channelrhodopsin-2 channel may be activated by brief pulses of light with a wavelength of about 450 nm with an intensity of between about 8 mW/mm<sup>2 </sup>and about 12 mW/mm<sup>2 </sup>and a duty cycle of about 1% and a pulse frequency of between about 100 Hz and about 120Hz, such as a 100 &#x3bc;s pulse every 10 ms. In addition, because light scatters in tissue and the required voxel size for therapy may not be well established, optical stimulation generator 60 may be designed to be scaleable with the ability to incorporate multiple stimulation circuits and outputs to increase the volume of activation by using multiple pathways. In another example, one or more lenses may be used to focus or dissipate the light, as desired to provide more intense or scattered optical stimulation in the target tissue. In one example, a lens may be created at a distal end of an optical fiber by modifying or distorting the distal end to form a lens that may focus or dissipate light once it reaches the distal end.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> may provide for the two wavelengths of stimulation light by having two light sources, one for each wavelength, such as a LED dedicated to each wavelength of light that feed into optical fibers <b>48</b> to deliver each wavelength of light to the target neurons depending on which LED is activated by optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> as controlled by processor <b>50</b>. Alternatively, a single light source <b>63</b> that is capable of emitting both wavelengths may be used, such as a tunable LED or other tunable light source, wherein a particular wavelength is selected based on a treatment program run by processor <b>50</b> that causes optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> to control light source <b>63</b> to emit the selected wavelength, such as by tuning the tunable LED or other tunable light source to the selected wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> may also control, under the direction of processor <b>50</b>, several other parameters with respect to the optical stimulation of the target tissue, such as the intensity of light emitted to stimulate the target tissue, the number of pulses of light to be emitted, the pulse width, the frequency of pulses, and the pattern of pulses, including burst patterns wherein optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> may control burst width, burst frequency, the number of pulses per burst, and the number of bursts. In one example, optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> is capable of delivering light with an intensity of between about 1 mW/mm<sup>2 </sup>and about 5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>. When light pulses are used as part of a stimulation program, optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> may, for example, produce pulses with a pulse width of between about 100 &#x3bc;s and about 15 ms, such as pulses with a pulse width of about 10 ms, and with a pulse frequency of between about 0.1 Hz and about 1 kHz, such as a frequency of about 0.2 Hz. In one example, optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> may drive optical stimulation with programmable modulation patterns that mimic existing patterns used in electrical stimulation for deep brain stimulation (DBS), and also allow for novel patterns that leverage the capabilities of the inhibitory optical transducer in the cell membranes.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In one example, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> includes a stimulation engine circuit <b>116</b>. In one example, optical stimulation engine <b>116</b> may include the capability to titrate pulse frequency and pulse width controlled via an external telemetry command and may provide programmable optical pulse trains to excite the transduction molecules. In one example, a constant current of 100 nA may be used to drive a reference current generator <b>121</b>, which may consist of an R-2R-based digital-to-analog converter (DAC) <b>122</b> to generate an 8-bit reference current <b>124</b> with a maximum value of 5 &#x3bc;A. In this example, the reference current <b>124</b> is then amplified in a current output stage <b>126</b> with a gain set by the ratio of R<sub>O </sub>and R<sub>Ref</sub>, which may be between 10 and 100, such as 40. With 512 current output stages <b>128</b>, the optical stimulation circuit <b>116</b> can drive two optical outputs <b>130</b>A, <b>130</b>B for activation and inhibition with separate sources, each delivering a maximum current of 51.2 mA with 10 bit accuracy. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, optical outputs <b>130</b>A and <b>130</b>B are shown as LEDs <b>132</b>A and <b>132</b>B, one for the activation wavelength and one for the inhibition wavelength of the opsins of the target neurons. The power requirements for optical components such as a LED or laser light source are generally larger than is required for conventional electrical stimulation. Moreover, the power required for optical components may be larger than that which can typically be provided by an implantable power source, such as a battery. Therefore, in one example, optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> includes a power management system within stimulation engine circuit <b>116</b> to allow power source <b>54</b> to provide power conditioning to boost the power provided by power source <b>54</b> to a level sufficient to power optical stimulation. Power management may be provided by the use of low overhead drivers to keep power dissipation low, and by an ability to modulate light intensity and its patterns as needed. In one example, a sense-resistor-based architecture may be used for current output stage <b>128</b> to eliminate the need to keep any output transistors <b>134</b> in saturation, reducing voltage headroom requirements to improve efficiency. A switched-capacitor <b>136</b> feedback may be used in current output stage <b>128</b> for low power consumption. The example optical stimulation circuit <b>116</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> may allow the stimulation pulse rate to be tuned from about 0.15 Hz to about 1 kHz and may allow tuning of the pulse width from about 100 &#x3bc;s to about 12 ms. Thus, optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> may be configurable, e.g., based on signals from processor <b>50</b>, to store a desired voltage for delivery of optical stimulation light at an intensity specified by a program, and optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> may be configurable to deliver stimulation pulses with controlled pulse widths and pulse frequencies based on signals from processor <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, telemetry module <b>56</b> may include a radio frequency (RF) transceiver to permit bi-directional communication between implantable stimulator <b>34</b> and each of clinician programmer <b>20</b> and patient programmer <b>22</b>. Telemetry module <b>56</b> may include an antenna <b>57</b> that may take on a variety of forms. For example, antenna <b>57</b> may be formed by a conductive coil or wire embedded in a housing associated with medical device <b>4</b>. Alternatively, antenna <b>57</b> may be mounted on a circuit board carrying other components of implantable stimulator <b>34</b> or take the form of a circuit trace on the circuit board. In this way, telemetry module <b>56</b> may permit communication with clinician programmer <b>20</b> and patient programmer <b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or external programmer <b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to receive, for example, new programs or program groups, or adjustments to programs or program groups. Telemetry module <b>56</b> may also permit communication with clinician programmer <b>20</b> to receive, for example, an image captured by the programmer of the lead placement along with information regarding the captured image and the therapy received by the patient during previous sessions, in accordance with this disclosure. Telemetry module <b>56</b> may also communicate information regarding previous therapy sessions that have been stored in memory <b>52</b>, to an external programmer during a subsequent therapy session; the information regarding a previous therapy session may have been imported by a programmer used in the previous session.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Power source <b>54</b> may be a non-rechargeable primary cell battery or a rechargeable battery and may be coupled to power circuitry. However, the disclosure is not limited to examples in which the power source is a battery. In another example, power source <b>54</b> may comprise a supercapacitor. In some examples, power source <b>54</b> may be rechargeable via induction or ultrasonic energy transmission, and include an appropriate circuit for recovering transcutaneously received energy. For example, power source <b>54</b> may be coupled to a secondary coil and a rectifier circuit for inductive energy transfer. In additional examples, power source <b>54</b> may include a small rechargeable circuit and a power generation circuit to produce the operating power. Recharging may be accomplished through proximal inductive interaction between an external charger and an inductive charging coil within stimulator <b>4</b>. In some examples, power requirements may be small enough to allow stimulator <b>4</b> to utilize patient motion at least in part and implement a kinetic energy-scavenging device to trickle charge a rechargeable battery. A voltage regulator may generate one or more regulated voltages using the battery power.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In one example, telemetry and power management may be controlled through a circuit <b>120</b>, shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Telemetry and power management circuit <b>120</b> provides for a bidirectional telemetry and RF-charging system. In one example, the telemetry carrier frequency is 175 kHz to align with a common ISM band and uses OOK at 4.4 kbps to stay within regulatory limits. A telemetry decoder <b>142</b> may use a chopper amplifier circuit, such as the chopper amplifier circuit described in Denison et al., &#x201c;A 2 &#x3bc;W 100 nV/rtHz Chopper-Stabilized Instrumentation Amplifier for Chronic Measurement of Neural Field Potentials,&#x201d; IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, vol. 43, pp. 2934-45 (2007), or as described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0269841, to Grevious et al., entitled &#x201c;Chopper Mixer Telemetry Circuit,&#x201d; or as described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/01800278, to Denison, entitled &#x201c;Chopper-stabilized Instrumentation Amplifier for Wireless Telemetry,&#x201d; the entire disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference, which may be configured as a combined down mixer-amplifier. An uplink <b>146</b> may be an H-bridge driver. One or more telemetry capacitors <b>148</b> may provide a tuning range of 50-130 kHz.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The system may include a temperature sensor, such as temperature sensor <b>124</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, to monitor the temperature at stimulator <b>34</b> or proximate to stimulator <b>34</b> during optical stimulation and recharge. Temperature sensor <b>124</b> may be used to adjust light delivery to the target tissue based on the temperature sensed by temperature sensor <b>124</b>. For example, temperature sensor <b>124</b> may be used to ensure that the peak temperature is constrained to under a 2&#xb0; C. increase over nominal body temperature per FDA guidelines, which can be a concern for driving less efficient opsin channels. In one example, if temperature sensor <b>124</b> determines a rise in temperature above a permitted temperature, such as more than about a 2&#xb0; C. increase over nominal body temperature, power management circuit <b>120</b> will modulate power in the device to avoid overheating of tissue and send an alert to processor <b>50</b>. In another example, processor <b>50</b> may cease optical stimulation and, in some examples, switch to electrical stimulation to mitigate the risk of overheating. In another example, adjusting the delivery of light from light source <b>63</b> may comprise one or more of: adjusting a pulse rate, a pulse width, an amplitude intensity, or a duty cycle of light delivered from light source <b>63</b>. Light source <b>63</b> is controlled by microcontroller <b>118</b>, which may receive signals from temperature sensor <b>124</b>, and optical stimulation engine <b>116</b>. Thus, it will be understood that any of the embodiments that provide optical stimulation may also deliver electrical stimulation.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram illustrating various components of another example implantable stimulator <b>34</b>. Like the implantable stimulator <b>34</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes an optical stimulation generator <b>60</b>, a processor <b>50</b>, memory <b>52</b>, a telemetry module <b>56</b>, and a power source <b>54</b> which have the same general configurations as described above for the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The example stimulator <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also includes sensing circuitry <b>65</b> electrically coupled to one or more leads <b>49</b>A, <b>49</b>B (collectively referred to as &#x201c;leads <b>49</b>&#x201d;) that each carry one or more sense electrodes, such as sense electrodes <b>17</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Sensing circuitry <b>65</b> receives electrical signals from the sense electrodes along leads <b>49</b> to provide for sensing of bioelectric activity within the patient before, during, and after optical stimulation controlled by optical stimulation generator <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a functional block diagram illustrating various components of an external programmer <b>40</b> for an implantable stimulator <b>14</b>. Although the components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are described in reference to external programmer <b>40</b>, the components may also be included within clinician programmer <b>20</b> or patient programmer <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, external programmer <b>40</b> includes processor <b>53</b>, memory <b>55</b>, telemetry module <b>67</b>, user interface <b>59</b>, and power source <b>61</b>. In general, processor <b>53</b> controls user interface <b>59</b>, stores and retrieves data to and from memory <b>55</b>, and controls transmission of data with implantable stimulator <b>34</b> through telemetry module <b>67</b>. Processor <b>53</b> may take the form of one or more microprocessors, controllers, DSPs, ASICS, FPGAs, or equivalent discrete or integrated logic circuitry. The functions attributed to processor <b>53</b> herein may be embodied as software, firmware, hardware or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Memory <b>55</b> may store instructions that cause processor <b>53</b> to provide various aspects of the functionality ascribed to external programmer <b>40</b> herein. Memory <b>55</b> may include any fixed or removable magnetic, optical, or electrical media, such as RAM, ROM, CD-ROM, magnetic disks, EEPROM, or the like. Memory <b>55</b> may also include a removable memory portion that may be used to provide memory updates or increases in memory capacities. A removable memory may also allow patient data to be easily transferred to another computing device, or to be removed before programmer <b>40</b> is used to program therapy for another patient. Memory <b>55</b> may also store information that controls operation of implantable stimulator <b>4</b>, such as therapy delivery values.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">A clinician or patient <b>36</b> interacts with user interface <b>59</b> in order to, for example, manually select, change or modify programs, adjust optical amplitude, pulse width, pulse rate, and other stimulation parameters, provide efficacy feedback, or view stimulation data. User interface <b>59</b> may include a screen and one or more input buttons that allow external programmer <b>40</b> to receive input from a user. The screen may be a liquid crystal display (LCD), plasma display, dot matrix display, or touch screen. The input buttons may include a touch pad, increase and decrease buttons, emergency shut off button, and other input media needed to control the stimulation therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Telemetry module <b>67</b> allows the transfer of data to and from stimulator <b>34</b>. Telemetry module <b>67</b> may communicate automatically with stimulator <b>34</b> at a scheduled time or when the telemetry module detects the proximity of the stimulator. Alternatively, telemetry module <b>67</b> may communicate with stimulator <b>34</b> when signaled by a user through user interface <b>59</b>. To support RF communication, telemetry module <b>67</b> may include appropriate electronic components, such as amplifiers, filters, mixers, encoders, decoders, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Programmer <b>40</b> may communicate wirelessly with implantable stimulator <b>34</b> using, for example, RF communication or proximal inductive interaction. This wireless communication is possible through the use of telemetry module <b>67</b> which may be coupled to an internal antenna or an external antenna. Telemetry module <b>67</b> may be similar to telemetry module <b>57</b> of implantable stimulator <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Programmer <b>40</b> may also be configured to communicate with another computing device via wireless communication techniques, or direct communication through a wired, e.g., network, connection.

<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Power source <b>61</b> delivers operating power to the components of programmer <b>40</b>. Power source <b>61</b> may be a rechargeable battery, such as a lithium ion or nickel metal hydride battery. Other rechargeable or conventional batteries may also be used.

Power source <b>61</b> may include circuitry to monitor power remaining within a battery. In this manner, user interface <b>59</b> may provide a current battery level indicator or low battery level indicator when the battery needs to be replaced or recharged. In some cases, power source <b>61</b> may be capable of estimating the remaining time of operation using the current battery.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In other examples, rather than being a handheld computing device or a dedicated computing device, programmer <b>40</b> may be a larger workstation or a separate application within another multi-function device. For example, the multi-function device may be a cellular phone, personal computer, laptop, workstation computer, or personal digital assistant that can be configured with an application to simulate programmer <b>40</b>. Alternatively, a notebook computer, tablet computer, or other personal computer may enter an application to become programmer <b>40</b> with a wireless adapter connected to the personal computer for communicating with stimulator <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">A conceptual diagram illustrating another example therapy system <b>70</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Like systems <b>2</b> and <b>30</b> described above, therapy system <b>70</b> is used to deliver optical stimulation therapy to patient <b>6</b>. Therapy system <b>70</b> includes an implantable medical device (IMD) <b>72</b> that delivers optical stimulation to patient <b>6</b> via one or more implantable optical fibers <b>11</b>. The optical stimulation provided by IMD <b>72</b> is essentially the same as described above for simulator <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and stimulator <b>34</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. IMD <b>72</b> also may provide the ability to deliver a therapeutic agent <b>73</b> to a target site within patient <b>6</b>. An example therapeutic agent that IMD <b>72</b> may be configured to deliver is a gene therapy agent that provides targeted delivery of a light-sensitive ion channel protein, also referred to as an &#x201c;opsin,&#x201d; to specific target cells, such as neurons within brain <b>16</b> or the spinal cord of patient <b>6</b>, such as by contacting the target cells with a vector, such as a lentivirus or a retrovirus, comprising a nucleic acid sequence that codes for the opsin so that the target cells express the opsin.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the therapeutic agent is a therapeutic fluid, which IMD <b>72</b> delivers to patient <b>6</b> through one or more catheters <b>74</b> coupled to IMD <b>72</b> that are implanted so that a distal end of catheter <b>74</b> is located proximate to the target cells. Stereotactic techniques or other positioning techniques may be used to precisely position fluid delivery catheters and/or optical fibers with respect to target tissue sites and to maintain the precise positioning throughout use. In some examples, after positioning, one or more fluid delivery catheters and/or optical fibers may be held precisely in place using fixation techniques or mechanisms such as those similar to the Medtronic StimLoc&#x2122; burr hole cover, manufactured by Medtronic, Inc., of Minneapolis, Minn. In some examples, the optical stimulation generator, i.e., including a light source, controller, power source, and telemetry circuitry, could be formed as a microstimulator that is structurally mounted on or integrated with a burr hole cover, such as a StimLoc&#x2122; burr hole cover. In this case, the optical fiber would run only from the skull to deep brain structures, instead of running from an implant pocket, such as an implant pocket near the clavicle. For this example, in some cases, the microstimulator device can be anchored to the skull using one or more bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which is a material used in spine and biologics procedures to fuse cervical or spinal discs.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In one example, one or more catheters <b>74</b> are provided to deliver the therapeutic agent <b>73</b> at or near the same location within the target tissue that is exposed to light <b>15</b> so that the therapeutic agent will promote expression of opsin by the target tissue at the same point where the target tissue will be exposed to optical stimulation. Catheters <b>74</b> could be side by side with optical fibers <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, or the optical fibers and fluid delivery conduits may be combined into a common unitary lead, such as within separate lumens within the unitary lead with a fluid conduit in side-by-side arrangement with an optical fiber or in a coaxial arrangement with the optical fiber being within the fluid conduit or vice versa. In one example (not shown), the optical fiber that delivers light stimulation to the target tissue may be a fiber with a hollow core so that light is passed through the outer fiber portion while the therapeutic agent is passed through the hollow core. In this case, the fiber may have an annular cross-section. In yet another example, a conduit may be provided that delivers the therapeutic agent to the target tissue while the optical fiber is threaded through the conduit such that the therapeutic agent is delivered in the annular region between the outer diameter of the optical fiber and the inner wall of the lead body.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Catheter <b>74</b> can comprise a unitary catheter or a plurality of catheter segments connected together to form an overall catheter length. An external programmer, such as clinician programmer <b>20</b> or patient programmer <b>22</b> or the external programmer <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, is configured to wirelessly communicate with IMD <b>72</b> as needed, such as to provide or retrieve therapy information or control aspects of therapy delivery (e.g., modify the therapy parameters such as rate or timing of delivery, turn IMD <b>72</b> on or off, and so forth) from IMD <b>72</b> to patient <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">IMD <b>72</b> may be implanted within a subcutaneous pocket relatively close to the therapy delivery site. For example, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, IMD <b>72</b> is implanted within a clavicle region of patient <b>6</b> so that IMD <b>72</b> may deliver the therapeutic agent to brain <b>16</b> of patient <b>6</b>. In other examples, IMD <b>72</b> may be implanted within other suitable sites within patient <b>6</b>, which may depend, for example, on the target site within patient <b>6</b> for the delivery of the therapeutic agent, such as within the abdomen for delivery of the therapeutic agent to the spinal cord of patient. In still other examples, IMD <b>72</b> may be external to patient <b>6</b> with a percutaneous catheter connected between IMD <b>72</b> and the target delivery site within patient <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Catheter <b>74</b> may be coupled to IMD <b>72</b> either directly or with the aid of a catheter extension (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, catheter <b>74</b> traverses from the implant site of IMD <b>72</b> to one or more target sites. Catheter <b>74</b> is positioned such that one or more fluid delivery outlets (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of catheter <b>74</b> are proximate to the target sites within patient <b>6</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, IMD <b>72</b> delivers a therapeutic agent through catheter <b>74</b> to target sites within brain <b>16</b>. IMD <b>72</b> may be configured for intrathecal delivery into the intrathecal space, as well as epidural delivery into the epidural space, both of which surround the spinal cord. The epidural space (also known as &#x201c;extradural space&#x201d; or &#x201c;peridural space&#x201d;) is the space within the spinal canal (formed by the surrounding vertebrae) lying outside the dura mater, which encloses the arachnoid mater, subarachnoid space, the cerebrospinal fluid, and spinal cord. The intrathecal space is within the subarachnoid space, which is further inward past the epidural space and dura mater and through the theca.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Although the target site shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is within brain <b>16</b> of patient <b>6</b>, other applications of therapy system <b>70</b> include alternative target delivery sites. The target delivery site in other applications of therapy system <b>70</b> can be located within patient <b>6</b> proximate to, e.g., sacral nerves (e.g., the S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, or S<b>4</b> sacral nerves), the spinal cord, or any other suitable nerve, organ, muscle or muscle group in patient <b>6</b>, which may be selected based on, for example, a patient condition. In one such application, therapy system <b>70</b> may be used to deliver a therapeutic agent to tissue proximate to a pudendal nerve, a perineal nerve or other areas of the nervous system, in which cases, catheter <b>74</b> would be implanted and substantially fixed proximate to the respective nerve. As another example delivery site, catheter <b>74</b> may be positioned to deliver a therapeutic agent to a deep brain site or within the heart (e.g., intraventricular delivery of the agent) or blood vessels. Delivery of a therapeutic agent within brain <b>16</b> may help manage any number of disorders or diseases including, e.g., chronic pain, diabetes, depression or other mood disorders, dementia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, migraines, obesity, and movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, spasticity, and epilepsy. In one example, the target site to which therapeutic agent is delivered via catheter <b>74</b> is proximate to the site that is stimulated by light <b>15</b> from optical fibers <b>11</b> so that the therapeutic agent <b>73</b> will modify the target cells that are desired to be stimulated by light <b>15</b>. In one example, described in more detail below, the therapeutic agent is a gene therapy fluid that modifies neurons within brain <b>16</b> to form opsins that are sensitive to the wavelength of light that is emitted by optical fibers <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In one example, IMD <b>72</b> can deliver one or more therapeutic agents to patient <b>6</b> according to one or more dosing programs that set forth different therapy parameters, such as a therapy schedule specifying programmed doses, dose rates for the programmed doses, and specific times to deliver the programmed doses. The dosing programs may be a part of a program group for therapy, where the group includes a plurality of dosing programs and/or therapy schedules. In some examples, IMD <b>72</b> may be configured to deliver a therapeutic agent to patient <b>6</b> according to different therapy schedules on a selective basis. IMD <b>72</b> may include a memory to store one or more therapy programs, instructions defining the extent to which patient <b>6</b> may adjust therapy parameters, switch between dosing programs, or undertake other therapy adjustments. Patient <b>6</b> or a clinician may select and/or generate additional dosing programs for use by IMD <b>72</b> via an external programmer at any time during therapy or as designated by the clinician.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In some examples, a single catheter <b>74</b> or multiple catheters <b>74</b> may be coupled to IMD <b>72</b> to target the same or different tissue or nerve sites within patient <b>6</b>. Thus, although two catheters <b>74</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in other examples, system <b>70</b> may include a single catheter, or more than two catheters, or the single or multiple catheters <b>74</b> may define multiple lumens for delivering different therapeutic agents to patient <b>6</b> or for delivering a therapeutic agent to different tissue sites within patient <b>6</b>. Accordingly, in some examples, IMD <b>72</b> may include a plurality of reservoirs for storing more than one type of therapeutic agent. In some examples, IMD <b>72</b> may include a single long tube that contains the therapeutic agent in place of a reservoir. However, for ease of description, an IMD <b>72</b> including a single reservoir is primarily discussed in this disclosure with reference to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The external programmer that is used to program IMD <b>72</b>, such as programmer <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, is an external computing device that is configured to communicate with IMD <b>72</b> by wireless telemetry. For example, the programmer may be a clinician programmer that the clinician uses to communicate with IMD <b>72</b> and program therapy delivered by IMD <b>72</b>. Alternatively, the programmer may be a patient programmer that allows patient <b>6</b> to view and modify therapy parameters associated with therapy programs. In one example the external programmer to program IMD <b>72</b> is the same external programmer <b>40</b> that is used to program stimulator <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or to program stimulator <b>34</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, or <b>4</b>. The clinician programmer may include additional or alternative programming features than the patient programmer. For example, more complex or sensitive tasks may only be allowed by the clinician programmer to prevent patient <b>6</b> from making undesired or unsafe changes to the operation of IMD <b>72</b>. In one example, programmer <b>40</b> to control the delivery of the therapeutic agent through catheter <b>74</b> is included as part of clinician programmer <b>20</b> or patient programmer <b>22</b> described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> so that the programmer <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>40</b> provides control over the delivery of optical stimulation therapy and the therapeutic agent.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">When programmer <b>40</b> is configured for use by the clinician, programmer <b>40</b> may be used to transmit initial programming information to IMD <b>72</b>. This initial information may include hardware information for system <b>70</b> such as the type of catheter <b>74</b>, the position of catheter <b>74</b> within patient <b>6</b>, the type and amount, e.g., by volume of therapeutic agent(s) delivered by IMD <b>72</b>, frequency of introduction of therapeutic agent(s), a refill interval for the therapeutic agent(s), a baseline orientation of at least a portion of IMD <b>72</b> relative to a reference point, therapy parameters of therapy programs stored within IMD <b>72</b> or within programmer <b>40</b>, and any other information the clinician desires to program into IMD <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The clinician uses programmer <b>40</b> to program IMD <b>72</b> with one or more therapy programs that define the therapy delivered by IMD <b>72</b>. During a programming session, the clinician may determine one or more dosing programs that may provide effective therapy to patient <b>6</b>, such as the frequency for the introduction of a gene therapy agent to a target tissue within patient <b>6</b>. Patient <b>6</b> may provide feedback to the clinician as to efficacy of a program being evaluated or desired modifications to the program. Once the clinician has identified one or more programs that may be beneficial to patient <b>6</b>, the patient may continue the evaluation process and determine which dosing program or therapy schedule best alleviates the condition of the patient or otherwise provides efficacious therapy to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The dosing program information may set forth therapy parameters, such as different predetermined dosages of the therapeutic agent (e.g., a dose amount), the rate of delivery of the therapeutic agent (e.g., rate of delivery of the fluid), the maximum acceptable dose, a time interval between successive supplemental doses, a maximum dose that may be delivered over a given time interval, and so forth. IMD <b>72</b> may include a feature that prevents dosing the therapeutic agent in a manner inconsistent with the dosing program. Programmer <b>40</b> may assist the clinician in the creation/identification of dosing programs by providing a methodical system of identifying potentially beneficial therapy parameters. In one example, the dosing program may be coordinated with the optical stimulation provided by stimulator <b>34</b>. For example, a dose of the therapeutic agent may be delivered, followed by a period of inactivity to allow the therapeutic agent to transfect the cells at the target site, such as for a few hours or a few days depending on the known time needed for the therapeutic agent to transfect the neurons, followed by an optical stimulation program, such as a program of light pulses having a particular pulse width, pulse frequency, and light wavelength and intensity. The optical stimulation may be followed up by a second dose of therapeutic agent. In another example, the dosing program may include one or more boluses of therapeutic agent delivered at selected times or intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In some cases, programmer <b>40</b> may also be configured for use by patient <b>6</b>. When configured as the patient programmer, programmer <b>40</b> may have limited functionality in order to prevent patient <b>6</b> from altering critical functions or applications that may be detrimental to patient <b>6</b>. In this manner, programmer <b>40</b> may only allow patient <b>6</b> to adjust certain therapy parameters or set an available range for a particular therapy parameter. Programmer <b>40</b> may also provide an indication to patient <b>6</b> when therapy is being delivered or when IMD <b>72</b> needs to be refilled or when the power source within programmer <b>40</b> or IMD <b>72</b> need to be replaced or recharged.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Whether programmer <b>40</b> is configured for clinician or patient use, programmer <b>40</b> may communicate to IMD <b>72</b> or any other computing device via wireless communication. Programmer <b>40</b>, for example, may communicate via wireless communication with IMD <b>72</b> using radio frequency (RF) telemetry techniques. Programmer <b>40</b> may also communicate with another programmer or computing device via a wired or wireless connection using any of a variety of communication techniques including, e.g., RF communication according to the 802.11 or Bluetooth specification sets, infrared (IR) communication according to the IRDA specification set, or other standard or proprietary telemetry protocols. Programmer <b>40</b> may also communicate with another programming or computing device via exchange of removable media, such as magnetic or optical disks, or memory cards or sticks including, e.g., non-volatile memory. Further, programmer <b>40</b> may communicate with IMD <b>72</b> and another programmer via, e.g., a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), public switched telephone network (PSTN), or cellular telephone network, or any other terrestrial or satellite network appropriate for use with programmer <b>40</b> and IMD <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a functional block diagram illustrating components of an example of IMD <b>72</b>, which includes a processor <b>50</b>, memory <b>52</b>, telemetry module <b>56</b>, fluid delivery pump <b>76</b>, reservoir <b>78</b>, refill port <b>80</b>, internal tubing <b>82</b>, catheter access port <b>84</b>, and power source <b>54</b>. Processor <b>50</b>, memory <b>52</b>, telemetry module <b>56</b>, and power source <b>54</b> may be the same components as those described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Processor <b>50</b> is communicatively connected to memory <b>52</b>, telemetry module <b>56</b>, and fluid delivery pump <b>76</b>. Fluid delivery pump <b>76</b> is in fluid communication with reservoir <b>78</b> and catheter access port <b>84</b> via internal tubing <b>82</b>. Reservoir <b>78</b> is connected to refill port <b>80</b>. Catheter access port <b>84</b> is connected to internal tubing <b>82</b> and catheter <b>74</b>. IMD <b>72</b> also includes power source <b>54</b>, which is configured to deliver operating power to various components of the IMD.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">During operation of IMD <b>72</b>, processor <b>50</b> controls fluid delivery pump <b>76</b> with the aid of instructions associated with program information that is stored in memory <b>52</b> to deliver a therapeutic agent to patient <b>6</b> via catheter <b>74</b>. Instructions executed by processor <b>50</b> may, for example, define dosing programs and/or therapy schedules that specify the amount of a therapeutic agent that is delivered to a target tissue site within patient <b>6</b> from reservoir <b>78</b> via catheter <b>74</b>. The instructions may further specify the time at which the therapeutic agent will be delivered and the time interval over which the agent will be delivered. The amount of the agent and the time over which the agent will be delivered are a function of, or alternatively determine, the dosage rate at which the fluid is delivered. The therapy programs may also include other therapy parameters, such as the frequency of dose delivery, the type of therapeutic agent delivered if IMD <b>72</b> is configured to deliver more than one type of therapeutic agent, and so forth. Components described as processors within IMD <b>72</b>, external programmer <b>40</b>, or any other device described in this disclosure may each comprise one or more processors, such as one or more microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable logic circuitry, or the like, either alone or in any suitable combination.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Upon instruction from processor <b>50</b>, fluid delivery pump <b>76</b> draws fluid from reservoir <b>78</b> and pumps the fluid through internal tubing <b>82</b> to catheter <b>74</b> through which the fluid is delivered to patient <b>6</b> to effect one or more of the treatments described above. Internal tubing <b>82</b> is a segment of tubing or a series of cavities within IMD <b>72</b> that run from reservoir <b>78</b>, around or through fluid delivery pump <b>76</b> to catheter access port <b>84</b>. Fluid delivery pump <b>76</b> can be any mechanism that delivers a therapeutic agent in some metered or other desired flow dosage to the therapy site within patient <b>6</b> from reservoir <b>78</b> via implanted catheter <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In one example, fluid delivery pump <b>76</b> can be a squeeze pump that squeezes internal tubing <b>82</b> in a controlled manner, e.g., such as a peristaltic pump, to progressively move fluid from reservoir <b>78</b> to the distal end of catheter <b>74</b> and then into patient <b>6</b> according to parameters specified by a set of program information stored on memory <b>52</b> and executed by processor <b>50</b>. Fluid delivery pump <b>76</b> can also be an axial pump, a centrifugal pump, a pusher plate, a piston-driven pump, or other means for moving fluid through internal tubing <b>82</b> and catheter <b>74</b>. In one particular example, fluid delivery pump <b>76</b> can be an electromechanical pump that delivers fluid by the application of pressure generated by a piston that moves in the presence of a varying magnetic field and that is configured to draw fluid from reservoir <b>78</b> and pump the fluid through internal tubing <b>82</b> and catheter <b>74</b> to patient <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Periodically, fluid may need to be supplied percutaneously to reservoir <b>78</b> because all of a therapeutic agent has been or will be delivered to patient <b>6</b>, or because a clinician wishes to replace an existing agent with a different agent or similar agent with different concentrations of therapeutic ingredients. Refill port <b>80</b> can therefore comprise a self-sealing membrane to prevent loss of therapeutic agent delivered to reservoir <b>78</b> via refill port <b>80</b>. For example, after a percutaneous delivery system, e.g., a hypodermic needle, penetrates the membrane of refill port <b>80</b>, the membrane may seal shut when the needle is removed from refill port <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In another example, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a small pump <b>180</b> and fluid reservoir <b>182</b> may be located proximate a distal end <b>184</b> of a delivery device, such as an optical fiber <b>11</b>, rather than within IMD <b>72</b>, as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. In one example, optical fiber <b>11</b> and pump <b>180</b> are implantable proximate the target tissue so that light <b>15</b> emitted from optical fiber <b>11</b> is substantially aligned with the target tissue adjacent to an output tube <b>196</b> of pump <b>180</b>. This alignment allows light <b>15</b> to be directed to the same target tissue that is being transfected by the therapeutic agent. Pump <b>180</b> may be carried on another delivery device, such as a catheter or lead. In one example, pump <b>180</b> comprises a small fluid reservoir <b>182</b> containing the therapeutic agent (e.g., transfecting agent) that is to be delivered to the target tissue. Pump <b>180</b> may be an osmotic pump that utilizes the principles of osmosis to force fluid from reservoir <b>182</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Osmosis is the transfer of a solvent, e.g., water, across a barrier, generally from an area of lesser solute concentration to an area of greater solute concentration. In one example, osmotic pump <b>180</b> may be adapted to cause fluid to flow from the patient's surrounding tissue into a small compartment <b>188</b> through a semi-permeable membrane <b>190</b>. This ingress of fluid into compartment <b>188</b>, in turn, displaces a barrier <b>192</b> located between compartment <b>188</b> and the adjacent reservoir <b>182</b> containing the therapeutic agent. Displacement of barrier <b>192</b> forces the therapeutic agent from reservoir <b>182</b> into the patient's body at a controlled rate, for example through an opening <b>194</b> in reservoir <b>182</b> and/or through a delivery outlet tube <b>196</b>. Delivery may occur after reservoir <b>182</b> is immersed in the body fluid. The rate of delivery may be controlled, for example, by selection of dimensions of compartment <b>188</b> and fluid reservoir <b>182</b>, the flexibility and dimension of displaceable barrier <b>192</b>, the size of opening <b>194</b> from fluid reservoir <b>182</b>, the construction of permeable membrane <b>190</b>, and/or the environment within compartment <b>188</b> into which the body fluid flows. Descriptions of osmotic pumps may be found in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2009/0281528 and 2008/0102119 entitled &#x201c;Osmotic Pump Apparatus and Associated Methods,&#x201d; both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In some cases, use of osmotic pump <b>180</b> and associated reservoir <b>182</b> located at distal end <b>184</b> of a delivery device such as optical fiber <b>11</b> may have advantages over pumps and reservoirs located within IMD <b>72</b>. For instance, the volume of tissue transfected by the therapeutic agent may be small. Likewise, the volume of tissue receiving an adequate amount of light <b>15</b> may also be small. By implanting a pump that is attached to the distal end <b>184</b> of the delivery device, such as optical fiber <b>11</b>, allows for the alignment of these two small volumes such that the desired target tissue is transfected by the therapeutic agent and is exposed to an adequate amount of light <b>15</b>, e.g. in order to activate the transfected target tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, at various times during the operation of IMD <b>72</b> to treat patient <b>6</b>, communication to and from IMD <b>72</b> may be necessary to, e.g., change therapy programs, adjust parameters within one or more programs, configure or adjust a particular bolus, send or receive an estimated length of catheter <b>74</b>, or to otherwise download information to or from IMD <b>72</b>. Processor <b>50</b> therefore controls telemetry module <b>56</b> to wirelessly communicate between IMD <b>72</b> and other devices including, e.g. programmer <b>40</b>. Telemetry module <b>56</b> in IMD <b>72</b>, as well as telemetry modules in other devices described in this disclosure, such as programmer <b>40</b>, can be configured to use RF communication techniques to wirelessly send and receive information to and from other devices respectively. In addition, telemetry module <b>56</b> may communicate with programmer <b>40</b> via proximal inductive interaction between IMD <b>72</b> and the external programmer. Telemetry module <b>56</b> may send information to external programmer <b>40</b> on a continuous basis, at periodic intervals, or upon request from the programmer.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Power source <b>54</b> delivers operating power to various components of IMD <b>72</b>. Power source <b>54</b> may include a small rechargeable or non-rechargeable battery and a power generation circuit to produce the operating power. In the case of a rechargeable battery, recharging may be accomplished through proximal inductive interaction between an external charger and an inductive charging coil within IMD <b>72</b>. In some examples, power requirements may be small enough to allow IMD <b>72</b> to utilize patient motion and implement a kinetic energy-scavenging device to trickle charge a rechargeable battery. In other examples, traditional batteries may be used for a limited period of time. As another alternative, an external inductive power supply could transcutaneously power IMD <b>72</b> as needed or desired. Measurement results for an example optogenetic stimulator system are summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The system was configured to produce a benchmark pulse train of 10 ms current pulse with an amplitude of 50 mA and a 5 s period, which after passing through the optical link between the light source and target tissue results in an optical power density of 5.3 mW/mm<sup>2 </sup>at the tissue interface. This power density is adequate for optical activation or deactivation, such as to activate a channelrhodopsin-2 for neuron activation and halorhodopsin for neuron deactivation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> also shows that RF powering provides <b>50</b>mA recharging current at a distance of 25 mm insuring a fast recharging capability for higher power designs relying on other opsin channels. Its efficiency is 7% at 25 mm, which is comparable to other inductively-powered neural systems.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The benchmarked system power, currently limited by the conversion efficiency of the LED devices, is approximately 400 &#x3bc;W assuming successful opsin transfection into chronic neural circuits and equivalent neuromodulation. This power level is comparable to current deep brain stimulation systems, while providing the advantages of genetically-targeted stimulation, MRI/EMI compatibility and enhanced modulation capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">An optogenetic modulation system such as system <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides for closed-loop feedback of the optical stimulation being generated by stimulator <b>4</b>. For example, a stimulation program may be initiated by processor <b>50</b> that causes optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> to activate a light source <b>63</b>, such as an LED or laser, which exposes a target tissue, such as a neuron population within brain <b>16</b> of patient <b>6</b>, to light <b>15</b>. As described above, because optical stimulation of light <b>15</b> does not generate a large electrical amplitude within the target tissue, bioelectrical activity within the target tissue may be monitored and recorded by sense electrodes, such as the implanted sense electrodes <b>17</b> on leads <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B, or a housing sense electrode <b>13</b>. Moreover, unlike with electronic stimulation wherein sensing substantially simultaneously with the delivery of an electrical stimulation pulse is impossible because of the masking effect of the large stimulation amplitude compared to the bioelectric activity of interest, the sensing of bioelectric activity that is provided by sense electrodes <b>13</b> and/or <b>17</b> can be performed continuously before, during, and after optical stimulation of the target tissue. The ability to perform substantially simultaneous sensing also allows for the elimination of circuitry that attempts to compensate for or remove the artifacts resulting from electrical stimulation, allowing for an implantable stimulator with a smaller size that uses less power than electrical stimulators. This continuous and simultaneous sensing allows processor <b>50</b> or an external programmer, such as clinician programmer <b>20</b> or patient programmer <b>22</b>, to not only record the effect of the performed optical stimulation, but also to provide a feedback loop that allows for adjustments to the treatment parameters of subsequent optical stimulations. In one example, the sense electrodes <b>13</b>, <b>17</b> are used along with processor <b>50</b> to provide closed loop feedback based on sensed bioelectrical signals, such as single cell action potentials, local field potentials, energy spectra in different bands, such as alpha, beta, or gamma bands of brain activity, electrical signals associated with electrocorticography (ECoG) or electroencephalography (EEG). Further examples of sensing bioelectric signals substantially simultaneously with delivery of light for optical stimulation are provided in the co-pending application Ser. No. 12/951,852 entitled &#x201c;Optical Stimulation Therapy,&#x201d; filed on the same date as the present application, which is assigned to the same assignee as the present application, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In one example, local field potentials (LFPs) may be used to sense neuronal activity in the brain continuously and substantially simultaneously with the delivery of optical stimulation. Low frequency power fluctuations of neuronal LFPs within discrete frequency bands can provide useful biomarkers for discriminating normal physiological brain activity from pathological states. LFPs may provide a measurement of the average or composite field behavior of many cells surrounding an electrode. Because LFPs represent the ensemble activity of thousands to millions of cells in an in vivo neural population, their recording may avoid chronic issues like tissue encapsulation and micromotion encountered in single-unit recording. LFP biomarkers are ubiquitous and span a broad frequency spectrum, from approximately 1 Hz oscillations in deep sleep to greater than approximately 500 Hz &#x201c;fast ripples&#x201d; in the hippocampus, and show a wide Q variation. As an example, high gamma band power fluctuations in the motor cortex may signal motion intent. Example techniques for monitoring selective frequency bands of physiological signals, including LFPs, are described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0082691 to Denison, entitled &#x201c;Frequency Selective Monitoring of Physiological Signals,&#x201d; the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Sensors may also be used to sense other biological parameters within the target tissue, such as inertial signals from an accelerometer, and pressure from a pressure sensor. After sensing a particular signal, processor <b>50</b> will run an algorithm and modulate the light provided to the target tissue appropriately. For example, sense electrodes <b>13</b>, <b>17</b> may show that a particular optical stimulation program did not provide sufficient activation or inhibition of activity within the target tissue, i.e., the optical stimulation may not have activated the target neurons such that a neuronal spike was not created. Processor <b>50</b> may be programmed to recognize the result of the optical stimulation and to determine a subsequent course of action, such as to maintain the same treatment program because the present treatment was sufficient or to modify the treatment program because the present treatment was either insufficient or overly sufficient. For example, if processor <b>50</b> determines that the present treatment provided insufficient stimulation of the target tissue, such as the desired neural activation was not achieved in brain <b>16</b> of patient, processor <b>50</b> may instruct optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> to either repeat the same treatment program or to modify the treatment program, such as by providing more pulses, pulses with a different wavelength, pulses with a shorter or longer pulse width, or pulses with a higher or lower intensity, pulses delivered in longer or shorter bursts or at higher or lower burst frequencies. If the repeated or modified optical stimulation treatment is still insufficient, then processor <b>50</b> may be programmed to determine that the target tissue is no longer responsive to light <b>15</b> because the desired opsins are no longer being expressed and to instruct fluid delivery pump <b>76</b> to deliver additional therapeutic agent, such as a gene therapy agent, to promote expression of the opsins of interest in the target tissue. Either immediately thereafter or after some programmably-selected delay, processor <b>50</b> may then instruct optical stimulation generator <b>60</b> to provide another round of optical stimulation to determine if the therapeutic agent was effective in promoting optical stimulation of the target tissue. In another example, sense electrodes are used to detect electrical signals or other parameters within the target tissue in order to predict certain outcomes such that processor <b>50</b> may direct optical stimulation to encourage, inhibit, abort, or prevent the outcome. For example, sense electrodes may be used to detect the start of a seizure and processor <b>50</b> may respond by initiating optical stimulation to attempt to abort the seizure, or sense electrodes may be used to predict an oncoming seizure so that optical stimulation may be used to prevent the seizure. The sense electrodes may also be used to determine if the optical stimulation has inhibited or aborted the seizure, such as by monitoring the beta band of brain activity to determine if the patient is in a therapeutically beneficial state compared to before the optical stimulation. If the optical stimulation has aborted the seizure, processor <b>50</b> may instruct that optical stimulation be ceased. If the optical stimulation was unable to inhibit or cease the seizure, processor <b>50</b> may alter the treatment program, such as by increasing light intensity, changing pulse parameters (such as pulse width, pulse rate), changing pulse type (i.e. regular pulses versus pulse bursts), changing the optical fibers used in the optical stimulation, such as by using a different set of optical fibers or a different number of optical fibers. In another example, sense electrodes may be used to measure beta bands of brain activity to modulate optical stimulation for movement disorder therapy. In another example, a posture sensor such as an accelerometer may be used for posture responsive stimulation associated with spinal cord stimulation.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In another example, optical stimulation may be controlled based on a determination of whether a patient is in a movement state based on a brain signal of the patient. The brain signal may include a bioelectrical signal, such as an electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, an electrocorticogram (ECoG) signal, a signal generated from measured local field potentials (LFPs) within one or more regions of a patient's brain and/or action potentials from single cells within the patient's brain. In some examples, the brain signal may be detected within a dorsal-lateral prefrontal (DLPF) cortex of the patient's brain. The movement state includes the state in which the patient is generating thoughts of movement (i.e., is intending to move), initiating movement, attempting to initiate movement or is actually undergoing movement. In order to determine whether the bioelectrical signal indicates the patient is in a movement state or a rest state, the bioelectrical signal may be analyzed for comparison of a voltage or amplitude value with a stored value, temporal or frequency correlation with a template signal, a particular power level within a particular frequency band of the bioelectrical signal, or combinations thereof. In one example, a processor of a bioelectrical sensing device may monitor the power level of the mu rhythm within an alpha frequency band (e.g., about 5 Hertz (Hz) to about 10 Hz) of an EEG signal. If the power level of the mu rhythm falls below a particular threshold, which may be determined during a trial period, the EEG signal may indicate the patient is in a movement state. Other biomarkers in other spectral bands may be used, such as spectral power, amplitude, or other characteristics of signals in the alpha, beta, gamma, or high gamma bands. The sensing device may then control a therapy device to deliver optical stimulation to the patient to mitigate the effects of a movement disorder. For example, the sensing device may generate a control signal that is transmitted to the therapy device and causes the therapy device to initiate optical stimulation delivery or adjust one or more parameters of the optical stimulation. In some examples, the therapy systems and methods also include deactivating the delivery of therapy or changing therapy parameters upon determining the patient is in the rest state (i.e., as stopped moving) or has successfully initiated movement, depending upon the type of movement disorder symptom the therapy system is implemented to address. In addition, in some examples, a first determination that the patient is in a movement stated based on brain signals may be confirmed by a second determination that is based on another source that is independent of the brain signals, such as a motion sensor. Examples of the types of signals that may be sensed and how they may be interpreted are disclosed in the commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/237,799, which is entitled, &#x201c;Therapy Control Based On A Patient Movement State,&#x201d; and was filed on Sep. 25, 2008, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">As discussed above, because optical fibers <b>11</b> are not electrically conducting, they do not provide a galvanic path for induced currents at the tissue interface so there is little to no risk of tissue capture or excessive heating that can occur due to gradient B fields or radio frequency (RF) fields, such as the fields associated with modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or electromagnetic interference (EMI). Moreover, the elimination of conductors from the tissue interface helps to mitigate MRI interference that is seen with typical electrical stimulation electrodes, allowing for continued high-resolution imaging post-implant. To retain these benefits provided by optical therapy delivery while also incorporating sensing capabilities into the system, in one example the structures that are proximate the target tissue, such as the sense electrodes, leads, fluid delivery structures, and optical fibers <b>11</b>, are made from materials that produce substantially no induced current in an electromagnetic field, and in one example the structures proximate the target tissue produce substanatially no heating in gradient B fields or RF fields. For example, the sense electrodes and any leads carrying them may exhibit a very high resistivity and overall impedance so that they may be used to detect the types of signals discussed above, including LFPs, action potentials, and other biological signals. In some examples, such sensors have a high overall impedance (e.g., the cumulative impedance of the entire structure of sensor <b>154</b>) of between about 100 Kiloohms and about 1 Megaohm. Examples of materials that may be used include a conductive polymer or a carbon fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In one example, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a high-impedance sensor <b>154</b> may be carried by an optical light guide, such as optical fiber <b>11</b>, wherein sensor <b>154</b> is distributed along the length of optical fiber <b>11</b>. Sensing is performed between high-impedance sensor <b>154</b> distributed along optical fiber <b>11</b> and a sensor on the housing of an implantable stimulator, such as housing sensor <b>13</b> on housing <b>14</b>, wherein sensor <b>154</b> and housing sensor <b>13</b> are in a uni-polar mode. In example, sensor <b>154</b> may be formed of a material that produces substantially no induced current in an electromagnetic field, such as the fields created by MRI or EMI. In one example, sensor <b>154</b> has an overall impedance of between about 100 Kiloohms and about 1 Megaohm. In one example, sense electrode <b>154</b> does not comprise any material that will produce significant induced current and/or heating when exposed to an electromagnetic field, such as gradient B fields or RF fields, for example the fields created by MRI or EMI. Examples of materials that may be used for sensor <b>154</b> include a carbon fiber or a conductive polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In one example, a sensor electrode <b>154</b> made from a conductive polymer or a carbon fiber is extruded over optical fiber <b>11</b> along the length of optical fiber <b>11</b>, and a sheath (not shown), such as a polyether urethane sheath, is deposited over and surrounding the conductive polymer sensor <b>154</b>. In one example, elongated sensor electrode <b>154</b> is formed of a conductive polymer or a carbon fiber, and a sheath is deposited over sensor <b>154</b>, followed by extruding an optical fiber around the sheathed sensor <b>154</b>. A high-impedance material is used because a current loop may be formed between sensor(s) <b>154</b>, housing electrode <b>13</b>, internal circuitry within housing <b>13</b>, and any intervening tissue. If a lower inductance material were used in the present of a magnetic field such as the fields resulting from MRI or EMI, undesirable tissue capture or excessive heating may occur. In one example, the materials of each component, e.g., optical fiber <b>11</b>, sensor <b>154</b>, and the sheath, comprises a material that produce substantially no induced current and/or heating in an electromagnetic field, such as gradient B fields or RF fields. In one example, all structures that are proximate the target tissue, such as optical fiber <b>11</b>, sensor <b>154</b>, and the sheath, do not comprise any material that will produce significant induced current and/or heating when exposed to an electromagnetic field, such as gradient B fields or RF fields, for example the fields created by MRI or EMI.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The use of materials for optical fiber <b>11</b> and sensor <b>154</b> having a very high impedance that produce substantially no induced current and/or heating in an electromagnetic field is advantageous in a neurostimulation system such as those described herein. The lack of an induced current results in little to no risk of tissue capture or excessive heating, even from components that would traditionally do so, such as sense electrodes and the leads thereto. This, in turn allows MRI and other imaging technologies that may create electromagnetic fields, to be used substantially simultaneously with optical stimulation such that imaging and analysis of the patients tissue may be taken and performed at the time of stimulation. Moreover, the use of materials that do not produce induced current in an electromagnetic field from the tissue interface, such as the materials of optical fibers <b>11</b> and sensor <b>154</b>, helps to mitigate MRI interference that is seen with typical electrical stimulation electrodes and sense electrodes, allowing for continued high-resolution imaging post-implant while still permitting for substantially simultaneous sensing during normal, day-to-day use of the optical stimulator.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In another example, housing electrode <b>13</b> is not used and need not be present, and sensing is performed between two sensors electrodes <b>156</b>A, <b>156</b>B which may be carried on the same optical fiber <b>11</b> (optical fiber <b>11</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), wherein sensing occurs in a bi-polar mode between sensors <b>156</b>A and <b>156</b>B. In one example, sensors <b>156</b>A and <b>156</b>B are positioned to extend along opposite diametrically opposed sides of optical fiber <b>11</b>. Any current loop that might exists in such an arrangement would be created between the conductors of sensors <b>156</b>A and <b>156</b>B and the sensing circuitry <b>65</b> in housing <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Sensing circuitry <b>65</b> may include a high impedance differential filter having an impedance on the order of about 1 Megaohm, and a differential amplifier that may filter out the common-mode signal from the two bi-polar sensed signals from sensors <b>156</b>A, <b>156</b>B. The high-impedance circuitry of sensing circuit <b>65</b> along with the small area between sensing conductors <b>156</b>A and <b>156</b>B due to their close positioning (only being spaced apart by optical fiber <b>11</b>) results in very low magnetic flux that is less likely to induce large voltages. In some examples, sensors <b>156</b>A, <b>156</b>B have a high overall impedance (e.g., the cumulative impedance of the entire structure of each sensor <b>156</b>A and <b>156</b>B) of between about 100 Kiloohms and about 1 Megaohm. In one example, sensors <b>156</b>A, <b>156</b>B are made from a conductive polymer or a carbon fiber. In one example, in order to have enough physical spacing between the sense conductors <b>156</b>A, <b>156</b>B so that a sufficient differential signal may be detected, one of sensors <b>156</b>A, <b>156</b>B may extend further than the other, e.g., so that the distal ends of sensors <b>156</b>A, <b>156</b>B are spaced apart. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, sensor <b>156</b>A is shown as extending nearly to the distal end of optical fiber <b>11</b>B, while sensor <b>156</b>B terminates more proximal to the distal end of optical fiber <b>11</b>B than sensor <b>156</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Although optogenetic modulation systems have been described with respect to modification and stimulation of neuron populations, such as brain or spinal cord neurons, the present invention is not so limited. Optogenetic modulation systems in accordance with the present invention may be used for treatment of other target tissues, such as, for example, cardiac tissue, gastrointestinal tissue, and pelvic floor tissue. In one example, an optogenetic modulation system may be used for treatment of atrial fibrillation by providing ventricular rate control though modification of the atrio-ventricular (AV) node so that conduction to the ventricles during AF is slowed to within a desired physiological range.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In one example, stimulation of the AV node may include transfection of the AV node with a light-sensitive ion channel, such as a Kv1.3 potassium channel, a G-protein (Gi) channel, a leak channel with correct voltage and time dependence, and IKr or IKs channels, and implanting a stimulator similar to stimulator <b>4</b> or stimulator <b>34</b> described above that delivers light to the transfected AV node tissue. One or more sense electrodes may also be used to detect AF and enable optical stimulation of the AV node. In one example, a lead is placed in the right atrium appendage to detect AF while one or more optical fibers are positioned in the AV node to deliver light to the transfected tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In another example, an optogenetic modulation system may provide for the suppression of AF triggers, such as triggers that originate in the pulmonary veins (PV) or the large vein ostia in the right atrium. AF triggers have been suppressed by using ablation to electrically isolate the trigger sites from the rest of the atrium. However, a disadvantage of ablation is that it irreversibly destroys tissue and may be associated with diminish atrial kick and compromised hemodynamics. Light-sensitive ion channels may be introduced to the PV ostia which, when triggered by optical stimulation, may depolarize the tissue to the extent that electrical activity from the focal triggers cannot travel to the rest of the atrium to trigger AF. In one example, the light-sensitive ion channel to suppress AF triggers may be a leak channel, such as a rhodopsin, that will provide for depolarization of the cell. In another example, atrial cells around the PV ostia may be transfected with a light-sensitive ion channel that could be optically stimulated with a generally circular light source or array of optical fibers when rapid triggered activity is detected in order to prevent initiation and/or sustenance of AF. In another example, optical stimulation may be provided in pulses with an appropriate duty cycle so that membrane potential is not hyperpolarized to stimulation levels.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In another example, an optogenetic modulation system may be used to suppress sympathetic activity associated with hypertension. In one example, light-sensitive ion channels that suppress this parasympathetic activity, such as leak channels or inwardly rectifying potassium channels, may be introduced to renal nerve cell bodies or sympathetic neurons in the lumbar region. Optical stimulation of these cells anchors the cell membranes to their resting potential and suppress the sympathetic activity. The optical stimulation may be performed on a substantially continuous basis or upon detection of elevated blood pressure, such as through the use of an implanted blood pressure sensor, for example a pressure sensor implanted in the RV outflow tract.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In yet another example, an optogenetic modulation system may be used to suppress errant biological pacemaker activity. Biological pacemakers have the potential to replace electronic pacemakers, however, the path to generating an effective biological pacemaker, including errant activity from the biological pacemaker that can cause undesired rapid firing of the biological pacemaker. A light-sensitive leak channel or IK1 channel, such as those encoded by Kir2.1 subunits, could be delivered at the same time as the biological pacemaker channels. Optical stimulation may be performed to activate the leak channels or IK1 channels and depolarize or hyperpolarize the cells so that rapid spontaneous activity by the biological pacemaker is either brought within the physiological range or stopped altogether. In another example, leak channels or IK1 channels may be introduced to the tissue encompassing the biological pacemaker so that upon optical stimulation the encompassing tissue can prevent rapid electrical activity of the biological pacemaker from propagating to the rest of the atria and ventricles.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In another example, optogenetic modulation system may be used to terminate or suppress ventricular tachycardia (VT). Prior methods that attempt to stop VT include anti-tachycardia pacing, such as with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or with a shock across the heart. During VT, electrical activity in the atrium travels in a circuitous path, and is often rapid. This electrical activity can compromise ventricular hemodynamics and be fatal. In one example, light-sensitive channels may be introduced to a line of tissue upon detection of VT. Once optically stimulated, the VT circuit can be shifted to this functional line of tissue, which would be associated with a change in the morphology of the VT on a far-field electrocardiogram. Other means of monitoring whether the VT circuit has shifted may include measuring the electrical potential using a monophasic action potential (MAP) electrode located proximate the functional line of tissue. Once it is confirmed that the VT circuit has shifted to the functional line of tissue, the optical stimulation is ceased to deactivate the light-sensitive channels, thus making the myocardium excitable and terminating the VT. This optical treatment of VT would be painless, as compared to the generally painful electric shock necessary to terminate most VT.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a flow diagram of an example method <b>200</b> for delivering optical stimulation. The example method <b>200</b> comprises delivering light to a target tissue via an optical stimulation device (<b>202</b>), such as from a light source of stimulators <b>4</b>, <b>34</b>, or <b>72</b> described above. During delivery of the light, a temperature at optical stimulation device <b>4</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>72</b> or proximate optical stimulation device <b>4</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>72</b> is sensed (<b>204</b>), and delivery of the light to the target tissue is adjusted based on the sensed temperature (<b>206</b>). Adjusting delivery of the light to the target tissue (<b>206</b>) may comprise reducing the power supplied to the light source, such as if the sensed temperature exceeds a threshold temperature, or adjusting at least one of a pulse rate of the light, a pulse width of the light, an amplitude intensity of the light, and a duty cycle of the light delivered by the light source. Adjusting delivery of the light (<b>206</b>) may also include ceasing delivery of the light, and if light delivery is ceased, optionally delivering electrical stimulation in place of the light stimulation.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a flow diagram of an example method <b>210</b> for delivering optical stimulation. The example method <b>210</b> comprises delivering light from an optical stimulation device, such as simulator <b>4</b>, <b>34</b>, or <b>72</b>, to a target tissue via an optical light guide, such as an optical fiber <b>11</b>, wherein the optical stimulation device is remote from the target tissue (<b>212</b>). The method <b>210</b> also comprises sensing bioelectric signals with a sense electrode (<b>214</b>), such as sense electrodes <b>17</b>, wherein optical light guide <b>11</b> and sense electrode <b>17</b> each comprise a material that produces substantially no induced current in an electromagnetic field, such as, for example, an electromagnetic field produced by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device. In one example, the material of the sense electrodes and/or the optical fiber comprise at least one of a conductive polymer or a carbon fiber. In one example method, the sense electrode is on a lead, such as lead <b>12</b>A, or <b>12</b>B, and the lead is made from a material that produces substantially no induced current in an electromagnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a flow diagram of an example method <b>220</b> for delivering optical stimulation. The example method <b>220</b> comprises delivering light from a light source of an optical stimulation device, such as LED <b>166</b> within stimulator <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>), to a window <b>162</b> of optical stimulation device <b>160</b> (<b>222</b>), delivering the light from window <b>162</b> to an optical light guide, such as an optical fiber <b>11</b>, optically connected to window <b>162</b> (<b>224</b>), and delivering the light to a target tissue via optical light guide <b>11</b> (<b>226</b>). Optical light guide <b>11</b> may be optically connected to window <b>162</b> via an optical index matching gel <b>170</b>. Window <b>162</b> may be hermetically sealed within housing <b>164</b> of optical stimulation device <b>160</b>. The example method may also include transfecting the target tissue with a light-sensitive channel protein sensitive to light in a wavelength range, wherein delivering light from light source <b>166</b> comprises delivering the light in the wavelength range, wherein delivering light from window <b>162</b> to optical light guide <b>11</b> comprises delivering the light in the wavelength range, and wherein delivering the light to the target tissue comprises delivering the light in the wavelength range.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a flow diagram of an example method <b>230</b> for delivering optical stimulation. The example method <b>230</b> comprises transfecting a target tissue with a light-sensitive channel protein sensitive to light in a wavelength range (<b>232</b>) and delivering light in the wavelength range to the target tissue via an optical stimulation device (<b>234</b>). The example method <b>230</b> also comprises sensing bioelectric signals substantially simultaneously and continuously with delivering light to the target tissue (<b>236</b>), determining a patient therapeutic state based on the bioelectric signals (<b>238</b>), and adjusting delivery of the light to the target tissue based on the sensed patient therapeutic state (<b>240</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Determining patient therapeutic state (<b>238</b>) may include determining whether the bioelectric signals indicate normal physiological activity of the target tissue, such as normal neural activity, or undesired activity, such as a pathological state. For example, the method may be used to provide closed-loop deep brain stimulation to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, spasticity, epilepsy, and dystonia. In some cases, the sensed bioelectric signals may result in a determination that the patient's therapeutic state indicates the onset of seizure, movement disorder symptoms, or other conditions. Upon such a determination, the method may trigger initiation or adjustment of optical stimulation to alleviate such symptoms. As an additional example, the method may be applied to support a cell-targeted treatment for schizophrenia, or for treatment of epilepsy via sensing and optical stimulation at various epileptic foci that provide distributed treatment of the epileptic foci.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a flow diagram of another example method <b>250</b> for delivering optical stimulation. Like method <b>230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the example method <b>250</b> comprises transfecting a target tissue with a light-sensitive channel protein sensitive to light in a wavelength range (<b>252</b>) and delivering light in the wavelength range to the target tissue via an optical stimulation device (<b>254</b>). The example method <b>250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> also comprises sensing bioelectric signals substantially simultaneously with delivering light to the target tissue (<b>256</b>), wherein the bioelectric signals comprises at least one of a local field potential proximate the target tissue, energy spectra in the alpha band of brain activity (&#x3b1; band), energy spectra in the beta band of brain activity (&#x3b2; band), energy spectra in the gamma band of brain activity (&#x3b3; band), electrocorticography (ECoG) signals, and electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The example method <b>250</b> further comprises adjusting the delivery of light to the target tissue based on the sensed bioelectric signals (<b>258</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Transfecting the target tissue (<b>232</b>, <b>252</b>) and delivering light to the target tissue (<b>234</b>, <b>254</b>) may be performed by a common implantable medical device, such as stimulator <b>4</b>, <b>34</b>, or <b>72</b>. For example, stimulator <b>72</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>) comprises a reservoir <b>78</b> and fluid delivery pump <b>76</b> for the delivery of a therapeutic agent capable of trasnfecting the target tissue, and an optical stimulation generator <b>60</b>, which may include a light source <b>63</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). A controller, such as processor <b>50</b>, may control the output of light source <b>63</b> and may also direct the adjusting of light delivery (<b>240</b>, <b>258</b>) based on the sensed bioelectric signals and/or patient therapeutic state.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Transfecting the target tissue (<b>232</b>, <b>252</b>) may comprise delivering a therapeutic agent, such as a gene therapy agent, to the target tissue that transfects the target tissue, such as via a pump <b>76</b> from a reservoir <b>78</b> in optical stimulator <b>72</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) or using an osmotic pump <b>180</b> at a distal end <b>184</b> of a delivery device <b>186</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). Transfecting the target tissue (<b>232</b>, <b>252</b>) may also comprise transfecting the target tissue with a first light-sensitive channel protein sensitive to light having a first wavelength range, for example an activating or exciting channel protein such as Channelrhodopsin-2 (described above), and transfecting the target tissue with a second light-sensitive channel protein sensitive to light having a second wavelength range, for example an inhibiting channel protein such as halorhodopsin (described above). If both the target tissue is transfected with both the first light-sensitive channel protein and the second light-sensitive channel protein, then delivering light to the target tissue (<b>234</b>, <b>254</b>) comprises at least one of delivering light to the target tissue in the first wavelength range and delivering light to the target tissue in the second wavelength range.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Delivering light to the target tissue (<b>234</b>, <b>254</b>) may comprise delivering light through an optical light guide, such as an optical fiber <b>11</b>, optically coupled to the optical stimulation device, which may deliver the light from light source <b>63</b> to the target tissue. Delivering light to the target tissue (<b>234</b>, <b>254</b>) may comprise delivering the light according to an optical stimulation program, such as a program configured for a particular patient condition or therapy.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention concerns an scFv antibody with improved features for tissue penetration and its topical application in the diagnosis and treatment of a disease dependent on the over-expression of a selected antigen. In particular, the invention concerns an antibody which specifically binds and inactivates said selected antigen.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">RELATED INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The contents of any patents, patent applications, and references cited throughout this specification are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Local treatment of many diseases can occur by topical application of a drug that must be able to penetrate epithelial tissue. Adjacent epithelial cells are sealed by tight junctions, preventing the passage of most dissolved molecules from one side of the epithelial sheet to the other (Alberts et al., Molecular Biology of the Cell, 2nd ed.). Tight junctions are crucial for the formation and maintenance of the paracellular barrier and for cell polarity in simple epithelia and endothelia. They also play an important role at the blood brain barrier, where they control substances that leave or enter the brain. Large molecular weight drugs need to pass through these tissue barriers in order to get to their sites of action. In general, antibodies are too big to cross the tight junctions of epithelial cell layers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As part of the body's normal activity, tight junctions selectively open and close in response to various signals both inside and outside of cells. This allows the passage of large molecules or even entire cells to across the tight junction barrier.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Mucosal administration of therapeutic compounds may offer certain advantages over injection and other modes of administration, for example in terms of convenience and speed of delivery, as well as by reducing or eliminating compliance problems and side effects that attend delivery by injection. However, mucosal delivery of biologically active agents is limited by mucosal barrier functions and other factors. For these reasons, mucosal drug administration typically requires larger amounts of drug than administration by injection. Other therapeutic compounds, including large molecule drugs, peptides and proteins, are often refractory to mucosal delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The ability of drugs to permeate mucosal surfaces, unassisted by delivery-enhancing agents, appears to be related to a number of factors, including molecular size, lipid solubility, and ionization. Small molecules, less than about 300-1,000 daltons, are often capable of penetrating mucosal barriers, however, as molecular size increases, permeability decreases rapidly. Lipid-soluble compounds are generally more permeable through mucosal surfaces than are non-lipid-soluble molecules. Peptides and proteins are poorly lipid soluble, and hence exhibit poor absorption characteristics across mucosal surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">US2006062758 provides compositions and methods that include a biologically active agent and a permeabilizing peptide effective to enhance mucosal delivery of the biologically active agent in a mammalian subject. The permeabilizing peptide reversibly enhances mucosal epithelial paracellular transport, typically by modulating epithelial junctional structure and/or physiology at a mucosal epithelial surface in the subject.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Peptides capable of modulating the function of epithelial tight junctions have been previously described (Johnson, P. H. and Quay, S. C., 2000). CA2379661 provides a paracellular drug delivery system comprising a Caludin-6 derived peptide. Claudins represent a super-family of integral membrane proteins located at the tight junctions and providing the barrier function.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Antibodies are powerful tools for biochemical and molecular biology research and are widely applied in medical diagnostics and therapy due to their ability to specifically bind to their antigen with high affinity. Typically, antibodies consist of two heavy and two light chains, which are covalently linked to each other via disulfide bonds. A highly variable domain comprising three complementary regions (CDRs) is positioned at the N-terminus of each chain. In concert, variable regions of the heavy and light chain determine antigen specificity of the antibody. Single chain antibodies (scFv) have been engineered by linking the DNA sequences encoding variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) domains with a spacer sequence coding for a flexible amino acid linker (Bird et al., 1988).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This format has the advantages over conventional full-length antibodies that an scFv is encoded by a single gene, mutations can be easily introduced, and the resulting scFv can be expressed in yeast and prokaryotic systems, which allow for rapid selection of specific high affinity binders to virtually any epitope by simple molecular biology. Due to their lack of effector function, scFv antibodies do not exert toxic effects via antibody-dependent or complement-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC or CDCC, respectively), and unlike full-length antibodies, scFv antibodies show good tissue penetration abilities.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Many single chain antibodies (scFvs) have been generated against a multitude of different antigens, in particular because they can be easily selected for high binding capacity using techniques such as phage display or ribosome display. Moreover, scFv antibodies can be produced in microbial systems which are associated with fewer costs compared to the production of therapeutic full-length antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition to conventional extracellular and in vitro applications, scFvs have also been successfully used for intracellular applications (Worn et al. 2000; Auf der Maur et al. 2002; Stocks M R, 2004); hence, scFvs directed against intracellular antigens have been developed. In general, intracellular expression of functional scFvs is limited by their instability, insolubility, and tendency to form aggregates. For this reason, in vivo screening systems for scFv antibodies, which are particularly soluble and stable under reducing conditions typical for the intracellular environment (e.g. nucleus, cytoplasm) have been successfully developed using a so called &#x201c;Quality Control&#x201d; screen (WO0148017; Auf der Maur et al. (2001); Auf der Maur et al., 2004) and have led to the identification of particularly stable and soluble scFv framework sequences for such purposes (WO03097697). Furthermore, these frameworks show exceptional expression levels and enhanced stability and solubility properties also under natural, oxidizing conditions in the extracellular environment. Hence, these favourable biophysical and biochemical properties translate into favourable high production yields and enable these antibody fragments, once directed against specific antigens, to be applied locally and/or systemically as protein therapeutics in particular therapeutic areas.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For the use of antibodies in many therapeutic applications, in particular local applications, an important factor is the ability of the antibody to penetrate tissues, and in particular epithelial tissue barriers.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Local application is particularly desirable for the treatment of disorders that are manifested at a particular locus and do not require a systemic treatment, for example eye diseases.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Uveitis Anterior</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Uveitis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the uvea with a prevalence of 30-40 per 100,000 (Lightman and Kok 2002). Uveitis is subdivided by location in uveitis anterior, intermediate or posterior. Uveitis anterior develops into uveitis posterior followed by complications such as cataracts, retinitis and even blindness, if left untreated (Kok and Lightman 2004). In &#x3c;65 year olds there are as many legally blind individuals as a result from uveitis as diabetic retinopathy (Kok and Lightman 2004). Uveitis anterior, as the most common form of intra-ocular inflammatory diseases, is associated with histocompatibility locus A allele B27 (HLA-B27) in 50% of the cases (Power et al. 1998). Of these patients, only about half suffer from an additional systemic disease such as ankylosing spondylitis or chronic inflammatory bowel disease (El-Shabrawi and Hermann 2002). The treatment of uveitis is primarily aimed at controlling the inflammatory process (Kok and Lightman 2004). Currently, corticosteroids are the mainstay for therapy of uveitis (Kok and Lightman 2004). Importantly, local and systemic corticosteroid treatment significantly increases the risk of glaucoma and cataract, thus limiting its repeated use (El-Shabrawi and Hermann 2002). Other treatments including methotrexate, cyclosporine or azathioprine require a minimum of 6 weeks treatment to produce an effect, leaving patients with an enormous constraint of quality of life for a long period (El-Shabrawi and Hermann 2002, Dick et al. 1997).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">From the above, a clearly defined medical need is obvious. Topical corticosteroids as the most common therapeutic option have significant side-effects, which in fact exacerbate the long term risk of blindness.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Recently TNF&#x3b1; concentrations of 15 pg/ml have been found in aqueous humor of uveitis patients, whereas the corresponding levels in healthy individuals were 0.56 pg/ml (Perez-Guijo et al. 2004). Several small clinical studies performed with systemically applied TNF&#x3b1; inhibitors report &#x201c;immediate improvement&#x201d; (El-Shabrawi and Hermann 2002) or &#x201c;marked clinical improvement within days&#x201d; (Murphy et al. 2004) or &#x201c;within 2 weeks&#x201d; (Joseph 2003) or &#x201c;significant improvement after the first infliximab dose&#x201d; (Benitez Del Castillo et al. 2004).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Thus, the concept of targeting TNF&#x3b1; is clinically well validated. However, safety concerns related to systemic application of TNF&#x3b1; inhibitors remain and would not justify their use in the significant fraction of uveitis patients who lack additional systemic disease manifestations.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Therefore, a topical TNF&#x3b1; inhibitor will fill a well-defined medical need, especially in patients with uveitis anterior. Due to their large molecular weight, the marketed TNF&#x3b1; inhibitors are not applicable topically (see Thiel et al. 2002).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Beh&#xe7;et's Disease</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Beh&#xe7;et's disease is an idiopathic, multisystemic, chronic, and recurrent disease, classically characterized by episodic aggressive ocular inflammatory attacks, orogenital ulcers and skin lesions. In rare, severe cases of Beh&#xe7;et's disease, articular, audio-vestibular, thoracic gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal or CNS involvement may be observed in addition. The eye is the most commonly involved internal organ in Beh&#xe7;et's disease and is the leading cause of chronic morbidity in patients. Ocular disease consists of unilateral (20%) or bilateral (80%) iridocyclitis, hypopyon or panuveitis running a chronic and relapsing course. In general, initial exacerbations tend to be more anterior and unilateral, whereas subsequent attacks tend to involve vitreal cavity and posterior segment of the eye, becoming bilateral (Evereklioglu 2005). Severe uveitis is more commonly observed among patients form endemic regions such as Japanese and Turkish patients, affecting 70-90% of this population (&#xd6;zen 1999; Tursen et al., 2003; Tugal-Tutkun et al., 2004; Yurdakul et al., 2004; Evereklioglu 2005). The risk of visual loss increases progressively, reaching one-fourth of the cases at 10 years. In addition, legal blindness is significant and eventually ensues in more than 50% of cases in countries with high prevalence and severity of the disease, such as Japan (Boyd et al., 2001; Evereklioglu 2005).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Beh&#xe7;et's disease exhibits a distinct geographic variation and is endemically higher particularly in Japan, Korea, Saudi-Arabia, Iran and Turkey as well as in the countries along the ancient &#x201c;silk road&#x201d;, including China and Israel (Bonfioli and Orefice 2005; Evereklioglu 2005). For example, Beh&#xe7;et's disease accounts for 20% of cases of uveitis in Japan and Turkey when compared with only 0.2% in the USA. In countries where the disease is endemic, it is more severe, with a higher frequency of ocular manifestations and complications and is more common in men, especially young male adults (Evereklioglu 2005). This peculiar epidemiology appears to be mediated by a combination of genetics (such as association with the HLA-B51 allele (Sakane et al., 1999; Verity et al., 1999; Evereklioglu 2005), infectious agents (Direskeneli 2001; Evereklioglu 2005) and environmental factors. The estimated prevalence of Beh&#xe7;et's disease is between 1:10,000 and 1:1000 in the Mediterranean countries, the Middle East, and the Far East. In Japan and Asian countries along the silk road, the prevalence is 13-30 per 100,000 and is highest in the northern parts of Japan; the highest overall prevalence with up to 400 per 100,000 is observed in certain parts of Turkey. There are approximately 15,000 people with Beh&#xe7;et's disease in the USA (Zierhut et al., 2003; Evereklioglu 2005).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Consequences of ophthalmic inflammatory attacks are the leading cause of chronic morbidity in Beh&#xe7;et's disease patients (Evereklioglu 2005). Treatment of Beh&#xe7;et's disease is symptomatic and empirical. As in other forms of uveitis, topical, periocular and systemic corticosteroids represent the mainstay of therapy in ocular Beh&#xe7;et's disease. However, the use of corticosteroid-based treatment modalities in the patients is limited by their significant side-effect profile. In addition, corticosteroids rarely induce complete remissions in ocular Beh&#xe7;et's disease and a significant fraction of patients develops steroid-resistant disease over time (Evereklioglu 2005). In the course of the disease, treatments frequently comprise immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, methotrexate and cyclosporine A. However, as these agents are associated with critical safety issues as well, there is a well-expressed medical need for an efficient and safe novel treatment modality in this indication.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Besides recent epidemiological findings that suggest polymorphic variations in TNF&#x3b1; to be associated with the severity of Beh&#xe7;et's disease (Verity et al., 1999b), there exists a broad variety of case reports and small clinical trials describing the use of infliximab in ocular Beh&#xe7;et's disease (Ohno et al., 2004; Wechsler et al., 2004; Giansanti et al., 2004; Lanthier et al., 2005; Tugal-Tutkun et al., 2005; Lindstedt et al., 2005). In fact, all these studies report rapid and complete remission of ocular Beh&#xe7;et's disease, even in patients resistant to conventional therapy (Tugal-Tutkun et al., 2005). However, the frequency and severity of adverse events in infliximab-treated uveitis patients is unexpectedly high in some studies, thus limiting the potential of systemically applied TNF&#x3b1; antagonists for treatment of this disease (Rosenbaum 2004; Suhler et al., 2005).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The clinical validation of TNF&#x3b1; as a highly attractive drug target in ocular Beh&#xe7;et's disease (Ohno et al., 2004; Wechsler et al., 2004; Giansanti et al., 2004; Lanthier et al., 2005; Tugal-Tutkun et al., 2005; Lindstedt et al., 2005) and the apparent safety concerns with systemic TNF&#x3b1; suppression in uveitis patients (Rosenbaum 2004; Suhler et al., 2005), reveals that there is a need for the development of a topically applicable TNF&#x3b1; antagonist for ocular Beh&#xe7;et's disease, especially for patients with predominant ocular symptoms.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Due to their good tissue penetration abilities and their rapid renal clearance, scFv antibodies are preferred for local applications. Besides charge, hydropathicity and molecular weight, properties such as solubility, aggregation tendency and thermal stability influence the ability of a molecule to penetrate through tissue barriers. For example, a highly soluble antibody fragment may not be able to penetrate epithelial barriers if it forms aggregates at physiological temperature around 37&#xb0; C. Mutation of a single amino acid residue in an scFv framework may on the one hand improve its solubility at ambient temperature, and this mutation may alter thermal stability and therefore lead to partial unfolding and aggregation at 37&#xb0; C. Such aggregates, due to their higher molecular weight, are no longer able to pass tissue barriers.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Because tissue penetration is an important factor for efficient drug delivery, in particular in local applications, there is a need for therapeutic antibodies, in particular scFv antibodies with improved tissue penetration abilities besides the otherwise desirable characteristics of high stability and low antigenicity. WO0040262 discloses antibody fragments, e.g. scFvs, as pharmaceuticals or diagnostic tools to treat or diagnose, respectively, ocular disorders. Eye penetration experiments are done at concentrations of 0.2 to 0.25 mg/ml scFv. It was shown that an scFv could penetrate the epithelial barrier of the cornea at a very low rate in the absence, and at higher rates in the presence of penetration enhancers. Since penetration enhancers can have cytotoxic effects or cause epithelial alterations, there is a need for alternative and/or improved methods for the treatment of ocular diseases by scFvs and fragments thereof. In particular, antibodies are needed for controlled therapy by local administration with a low degree of side effects, which can be administered at a relatively high concentration.</p>

<p id="p-0090" num="0090">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; refers to whole antibodies and any antigen-binding fragment (i.e., &#x201c;antigen-binding portion,&#x201d; &#x201c;antigen-binding polypeptide,&#x201d; or &#x201c;immuno-binder&#x201d;) or single chain thereof. An &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; refers to a glycoprotein comprising at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds, or an antigen-binding portion thereof. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0091">The term &#x201c;antigen-binding&#x201d; refers to the ability to specifically bind to an antigen. It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term &#x201c;antigen-binding portion&#x201d; of an antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a single domain or dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR) or (vii) a combination of two or more isolated CDRs which may optionally be joined by a synthetic linker. Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) Science 242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883). These antibody fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to those with skill in the art, and the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0092">As used, &#x201c;immunoglobulin&#x201d; may refer to any recognized class or subclass of immunoglobulins such as IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, or IgE. The immunoglobulin can be derived from any species, such as human, murine, or rabbit origin. Further, the immunoglobulin may be polyclonal, monoclonal, or fragments. Such immunoglobulin fragments may include, for example, the Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)2, Fv or Fab fragments, or other antigen recognizing immunoglobulin fragments. Such immunoglobulin fragments can be prepared, for example, by proteolytic enzyme digestion, for example, by pepsin or papain digestion, reductive alkylation, or recombinant techniques. The materials and methods for preparing such immunoglobulin fragments are well-known to those skilled in the art (Parham, (1983) J. Immunology, 131:2895; Lamoyi et al., (1983) J. Immunological Methods, 56:235; Parham, (1982) J. Immunological Methods, 53:133; and Matthew et al., (1982) J. Immunological Methods, 50:239).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0093">In addition the immunoglobulin may be a single chain antibody (&#x201c;SCA&#x201d;). These may consist of single chain Fv fragments (&#x201c;scFv&#x201d;) in which the variable light (&#x201c;VL&#x201d;) and variable heavy (&#x201c;VH&#x201d;) domains are linked by a peptide bridge or by disulfide bonds. Also, the immunoglobulin may consist of single VH domains (dabs) which possess antigen-binding activity. See, e.g., G. Winter and C. Milstein, Nature, 349, 295 (1991); R. Glockshuber et al., Biochemistry 29, 1362 (1990); and, E. S. Ward et al., Nature 341, 544 (1989).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0094">As used herein, the term &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; refers to a polymer of two or more of the natural amino acids or non-natural amino acids. The polypeptides of the invention comprise at least one amino acid sequence derived from an immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule. In one embodiment a polypeptide of the invention comprises an amino acid sequence or one or more moieties not derived from an immunoglobulin molecule. Exemplary modifications are described in more detail below. For example, in one embodiment, a polypeptide of the invention may comprise a flexible linker sequence. In another embodiment, a polypeptide may be modified to add a functional moiety (e.g., PEG, a drug, or a label).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0095">Preferred polypeptides of the invention comprise an amino acid sequence derived from a human immunoglobulin sequence. However, polypeptides may comprise one or more amino acids from another mammalian species. For example, a primate heavy chain portion, hinge portion, or binding site may be included in the subject polypeptides. Alternatively, one or more murine amino acids may be present in a polypeptide. Preferred polypeptides of the invention are not immunogenic.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0096">It will also be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the polypeptides of the invention may be altered such that they vary in amino acid sequence from the naturally occurring or native polypeptide from which they were derived, while retaining the desirable activity of native polypeptide. For example, nucleotide or amino acid substitutions leading to conservative substitutions or changes at &#x201c;non-essential&#x201d; amino acid residues may be made. An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a non-natural variant of a polypeptide derived from an immunoglobulin (e.g., an immunoglobulin heavy chain portion or light chain portion) can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of the immunoglobulin such that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations may be introduced by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0097">The polypeptides of the invention may comprise conservative amino acid substitutions at one or more non-essential amino acid residues. A &#x201c;conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d; is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art, including basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a nonessential amino acid residue in polypeptide is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. In another embodiment, a string of amino acids can be replaced with a structurally similar string that differs in order and/or composition of side chain family members. Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations may be introduced randomly along all or part of the immunoglobulin coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be incorporated into polypeptides of the invention and screened for their ability to bind to the desired target.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0098">The terms &#x201c;specific binding,&#x201d; &#x201c;selective binding,&#x201d; &#x201c;selectively binds,&#x201d; and &#x201c;specifically binds,&#x201d; refer to antibody binding to an epitope on a predetermined antigen. Typically, the antibody binds with an affinity (KD) of approximately less than 10-6 M, such as approximately less than 10-7 M, 10-8 M or 10-9 M or even lower.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0099">The term &#x201c;KD&#x201d; refers to the dissociation equilibrium constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. Typically, the antibodies of the invention bind to their target antigen with a dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) of less than approximately 10-6 M, such as less than approximately 10-7 M, 10-8 M or 10-9 M or even lower, for example, as determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology in a BIACORE instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0100">The term &#x201c;transit kinetics&#x201d; or &#x201c;pharmacokinetics&#x201d; as used herein refers to all factors related to the dynamics of drug absorption, distribution in body tissues or fluids and metabolism and/or elimination. This involves the physicochemical factors that regulate the transfer of the polypeptide across membranes because the absorption, distribution, biotransformation and excretion of a polypeptide all involve the passage of the polypeptide across cell membranes.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0101">Of great interest to the clinician is the bioavailability of a polypeptide. This term, as used herein, indicates the extent to which a polypeptide reaches its site of action or a biological fluid from which the polypeptide has access to its site of action. The factors affecting bioavailability include rate of absorption and metabolism or elimination of the polypeptide from the subject. Many factors affect absorption, these include the numerous physicochemical factors that affect transport across membranes such as a polypeptide solubility and uptake mechanisms as well as factors such as site of administration and the formulation (concentration) and composition of the polypeptide. The various routes of polypeptide administration have markedly different absorption characteristics. These routes include oral ingestion, pulmonary absorption, parenteral injection, including; intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, intrathecal or intraperitoneal injection and topical application to mucous membranes, skin or eye. In a preferred embodiment, a polypeptide of the invention for treating eye disease is administered topically to the surface of the eye, e.g., in the form of eye drops. The transit kinetics of a polypeptide of the invention can be determined using, for example, any of the cell or animal based molecules disclosed herein, and are typically selected to be suitable for clinically relevant transit across the tight junctions of the blood brain barrier, intestine, or the eye.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0102">The term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; is known in the art, and, as used herein, refers to a warm-blooded animal, more preferably a mammal, including, e.g., non-human animals such as rats, mice, rabbits, cats, dogs, sheep, horses, cattle, in addition to humans. In a preferred embodiment, the subject is a human. The subjects are those susceptible to treatment with a soluble antigen-binding polypeptide of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0103">A &#x201c;penetration enhancing agent&#x201d; or &#x201c;penetration enhancer&#x201d; as used herein, refers to molecules or compounds that promote transit across an epithelial junction. Penetration enhancing agents for use with the present invention include, but are not limited to, azone, benzalkonium chloride (BzCl), BL-7, BL-9, Brij 35, Brij 78, Brij 98, Brij 99, Polyoxyethylene-Polyoxypropylene 1800, sodium caprate, caprylic acid, cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorhexidine, cholate, castor oil, corn oil, cremophor-EL, DMSO, decamethonium bromide, deoxycholate, dextransulfate, EDTA, disodium EDETATE, ethanol, fusidate, glycocholate, lauryl sulfate, L-&#x3b1;-lysophosphatidylocholine, N-lauroylsarcosine, NMP, oleic acid, phospholipids, poly oxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, saponin, Tween 20, Tween 40, Tween 60, Tween 80, taurocholeate, and taurodeoxycholate. For example, in some embodiments, the penetration enhancing agent is sodium caprate. In other embodiments, the penetration enhancing agent is chlorhexidine.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0104">In a first aspect of the present invention an scFv antibody is provided that specifically binds a selected antigen and has improved tissue penetration ability. Said antibody is characterized in that it is obtainable by a method comprising</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0105">(i) selecting from a pool of soluble and stable frameworks the framework matching best to the framework with a non-human antibody of a selected antigen-binding specificity,</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0106">(ii) either providing said framework with CDRs that bind said antigen or mutating the framework of said non-human antibody towards the sequence of said soluble and stable framework,</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0107">(iii) testing the generated antibody for solubility and stability, and</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0108">(iv) testing the generated antibody for antigen binding.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0109">The term &#x201c;matching best&#x201d; means being as close as possible with respect to primary or tertiary structure.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0110">In general, the antibody of the present invention comprises a framework with a VL and/or a VH domain, said framework being selected from at least part of a natural human antibody repertoire by an antigen independent method for high intracellular stability and solubility in a yeast cell. Said method is also known as the &#x201c;quality control&#x201d; screening of antibody frameworks and has resulted in a selection of particularly stable and soluble antibody frameworks that are characterized by high intracellular stability and solubility. These frameworks can be used for example in a second, yeast based screening system for antigen specificity. In this case, CDRs of a particularly stable and soluble antibody can be randomized and the resulting antibodies can be screened for best possible antigen recognition. Alternatively, known antibody CDRs of antibodies with strong binding affinity to an antigen of choice can be grafted onto said particularly stable and soluble frameworks. Optionally, said antibody can be further improved by mutagenesis of selected CDR(s) and/or framework, selecting improved clones in the &#x201c;quality control system&#x201d; (WO0148017, Auf der Maur et al. 2004), i.e. by mutating said scFv antibody by site-directed or random mutagenesis of one or more selected CDRs and/or the framework and selecting for stable and soluble antibodies under the same or under more stringent conditions. Selection can be done in vivo in the yeast quality control system.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0111">The term &#x201c;framework residues&#x201d; relates to amino acid residues of antigen-binding polypeptide units, or the corresponding amino acid residues of antigen-binding polypeptide modules, which contribute to the folding topology, i.e. which contribute to the fold of said unit (or module) or which contribute to the interaction with a neighboring unit (or module). Such contribution might be the interaction with other residues in the unit (or module), or the influence on the polypeptide backbone conformation as found in &#x3b1;-helices or &#x3b2;-sheets, or amino acid stretches forming linear polypeptides or loops. The term &#x201c;target interaction residues&#x201d; refers to amino acid residues of the units, or the corresponding amino acid residues of the modules, which contribute to the interaction with target substances. Such contribution might be the direct interaction with the target substances, or the influence on other directly interacting residues, e.g. by stabilizing the conformation of the (poly)peptide of said unit (or module) to allow or enhance the interaction of said directly interacting residues with said target. Such framework and target interaction residues may be identified by analysis of the structural data obtained by the physicochemical methods referred to above, or by comparison with known and related structural information well known to practitioners in structural biology and/or bioinformatics. Such frameworks can also be referred to as scaffolds as they provide support for the presentation of the more divergent target interaction residues or CDRs.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0112">CDRs or target interaction residues can be grafted into suitable frameworks, such as alternative scaffolds which are well-known in the art and include, but are not limited to, CTLA-4, tendamistat, fibronectin (FN3), neocarzinostatin, CBM4-2, lipocalins, T-cell receptor, Protein A domain (protein Z), Im9, designed ankyrin-repeat proteins (DARPins), designed TPR proteins, zinc finger, pVIII, avian pancreatic polypeptide, GCN4, WW domain, Src homology domain 3 (SH3), Src homology domain 2 (SH2), PDZ domains, TEM-1 &#x3b2;-lactamase, GFP, thioredoxin, staphylococcal nuclease, PHD-finger, CI-2, BPT1 APPI, HPSTI, ecotin, LACI-D1, LDTI, MTI-II, scorpion toxins, insect defensin A peptide, EETI-II, Min-23, CBD, PBP, cytochrome b<sub>562</sub>, Ldl receptor domain A, &#x3b3;-crystallin, ubiquitin, transferring, and C-type lectin-like domain (see Binz et al.

(2005), Nat. Biotechnol. 23(9), pp. 1126-1136).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0113">Preferably, the antibody of the present invention has one or more of the following further features:

Said yeast interaction assay, the so-called &#x201c;Quality control&#x201d;, was described in detail (Auf der Maur et al. (2001); Auf der Maur et al., 2004; the references being incorporated in their entirety herein).</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0115">is stable for at least 1 month, preferably at least two months, most preferred at least six months at 20&#xb0; C. to 40&#xb0; C., preferably at 37&#xb0; C. in PBS,</li>

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0119">The term antibody as used in the scope of the present invention refers to an scFv antibody or an antibody fragment that binds a selected antigen. Thus, the scFv antibody of the present invention can be either a full scFv comprising a VL and a VH domain which are linked by a short linker peptide, for example a linker comprising 1 to 4 repeats of the sequence GGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 22), preferably a (GGGGS)<sub>4 </sub>peptide (SEQ ID No. 16), more preferably a linker of the sequence GGGGSGGGGSGGGGSSGGGS (SEQ ID No:17), or a linker as disclosed in Alfthan et al. (1995) Protein Eng. 8:725-731, or simply a VL or a VH domain, which has sufficient binding capacity for the selected antigen. The linkage of VL and VH can be in either orientation, VL-linker-VH or VH-linker-VL.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0120">In one aspect the present invention provides an antibody which is stable for at least 1 month, preferably at least two months, in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Preferably said antibody is tested for stability at physiological temperature, i.e. at 37&#xb0; C. In another preferred embodiment said antibody is stable for at least 6 month when kept at 4&#xb0; C. in PBS, or after lyophilization at room temperature. The stability can be tested for example by analyzing standard amounts of said antibodies by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by a standard staining procedure, such a Coomassie staining or silver staining, and comparing the staining intensity of the full-length band with that of a standard protein. In addition, the absence of degradation products is checked. Degraded protein runs as a smear, or is even invisible due to the shortness of the degradation products, in which case only the loss of intensity of the full-length protein band indicates degradation. In general, a physical stability of an antibody can be assumed if no signs of aggregation, precipitation and/or denaturation upon visual inspection of color and/or clarity or as measured by UV light scattering or by size exclusion chromatography are observed.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0121">The stability in terms of activity after a certain time of storage is a further important feature of the antibody of the present invention. It can be determined comparing the potency of the antibody before and after storage, for example in by in vitro target binding assays using ELISA or in vivo in cellular activity assays where the inhibition potency of the antibody is measured.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0122">In another aspect the present invention provides an antibody which is and remains monomeric under physiological conditions, as can be judged e.g. by gel filtration. The monomeric state is an important feature of antibodies that are able to penetrate through epithelial barriers.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0123">In a further aspect the present invention provides an antibody, which is soluble at ambient temperature in PBS at concentrations of greater than about 1 mg/ml, preferably of greater than about 4 mg/ml, most preferably of about 10 mg/ml. The solubility of the purified antibody can be determined by PEG precipitation using PEG3000, or by self-interaction-chromatography (SIC)</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0124">In yet another aspect the present invention provides an antibody, which reveals a midpoint of transition in a guanidinium hydrochloride titration of at least about 1.5 M, preferably of at least about 1.75 M, more preferably of at least about 1.9 M, most preferably of at least about 2 M. This is a measure for stability in the sense of resistance towards unfolding, whereby the unfolding/denaturation induced by the addition of guanidinium hydrochloride is followed by fluoresces or circular dichroism spectroscopy.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0125">In a further aspect of the present invention, the antibody having one or more of the afore mentioned biophysical characteristics is structurally characterized by a framework of the light chain variable domain (VL) of at least 85% similarity, preferably at least about 95% similarity, most preferably at least about 98% identity to a VL framework selected from the group comprising SEQ. ID. NO. 1 (kappa1 type), SEQ. ID. NO. 2 (kappa1 type), SEQ. ID. NO. 3 (kappa3 type) or SEQ. ID. NO. 4 (lambda1 type), SEQ ID No. 5 (kappa3 type), SEQ ID No. 6 (lambda3 type), or SEQ ID No. 7 (lambda3 type) and/or a framework of the heavy chain variable domain (VH) of at least 85% similarity, preferably at least about 95% similarity, most preferred at least about 98% identity to a VH framework selected from the group comprising Seq. Id. No. 8 (H3 type, SEQ ID No:9 (H3 type), SEQ ID No. 10 (H1b type), or SEQ ID No. 11 (H3 type). In a preferred embodiment, the combination between VL homologues of SEQ ID No:2 and VH homologues of SEQ ID No:8, combination between VL homologues of SEQ ID No:4 and VH homologues of SEQ ID No: 10, or combinations between homologues of anyone of the above mentioned VL sequences a VH homologue of SEQ ID No:9 are used. More preferred are antibodies with &#x3e;90% similarity, and even more preferred with &#x3e;95% similarity to SEQ ID No. 7. Most preferred are antibodies of the sequence SEQ ID No:7 and/or SEQ ID No:8. It is also understood that the invention encompasses any one of the VL sequences disclosed in combination with any one of the VH sequences disclosed so long as target binding specificity is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0126">The percent similarity between two sequences is a measure of the extent to which protein sequences are related. The extent of similarity between two sequences can be based on percent sequence identity and/or conservation. Conservation refers to changes at a specific position of an amino acid sequence that preserve the physico-chemical properties of the original residue. The similarity between sequences is typically determined by sequence alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0127">The similarities referred to herein are to be determined by using the BLAST programs (Basic Local Alignment Search Tools; see Altschul, S. F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E. W. &#x26; Lipman, D. J. (1990) &#x201c;Basic local alignment search tool.&#x201d; J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410) accessible in Internet. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3 to obtain similar amino acid sequences to the protein molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al., (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25(17):3389-3402. When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. The percent identity between two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm, which is well known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0128">The percent identity between two nucleotide sequences can be determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package, using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The percent identity between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences can also be determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller (CABIOS, 4:11-17 (1989)) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM120 weight resi-due table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. In addition, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences can be determined using the Needle-man and Wunsch (J. Mol. Biol. (48):444-453 (1970)) algo-rithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package, using either a Blossum 62 ma-trix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0129">In another aspect the antibody of the present invention is chemically modified. Chemical modifications may change properties of the antibody such as stability, solubility, antigen-binding specificity or affinity, in vivo half life cytotoxicity, and tissue penetration ability. Chemical modifications are well known to the skilled person. A preferred chemical modification of the antibody of the present invention is PEGylation.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0130">In another preferred aspect, the affinity of the antibody of the present invention is characterized by a dissociation constant Kd of less than about 100 nM, preferably less than about 10 nM, and most preferably less than about 1 nM. Binding parameters such as affinity of the antibody to its cognate antigen are determined by surface plasmon resonance (BiaCore) or ELISA. These methods are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0131">Preferably, the antigen that is bound by the antibody of the present invention is TNF&#x3b1; (tumour necrosis factor alpha). TNF&#x3b1;, also known as cachectin, is a naturally occurring mammalian cytokine produced by numerous cell types, including monocytes and macrophages in response to endotoxin or other stimuli. TNF&#x3b1; is a major mediator of inflammatory, immunological, and pathophysiological reactions (Grell, M., et al. (1995) Cell, 83: 793-802). A large number of disorders are associated with elevated levels of TNF&#x3b1;, many of them of significant medical importance. TNF&#x3b1; has been shown to be up-regulated in a number of human diseases, including chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disorders including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, sepsis, congestive heart failure, asthma bronchiale and multiple sclerosis. TNF&#x3b1; is also referred to as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. However, it is also involved in disorders with a local manifestation, such as eye diseases, e.g. macular degeneration, uveitis, glaucoma, cataract, retinitis, dry eye syndrome, scleritis, conjunctivitis, and keratitis. The antibody of the present invention is particularly suitable for the treatment of such diseases, as it can be a applied locally and topically, for example for eye diseases by eye drops.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0132">The present invention also provides a DNA sequence encoding the antibody of the present invention, as well as a cloning or expression vector containing said DNA sequence. In addition, a suitable host cell transformed with said DNA sequence is provided. This can be a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell, in particular an <i>E. coli</i>, yeast, plant, insect or a mammalian cell.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0133">The antibody of the present invention may be generated using routine techniques in the field of recombinant genetics. Knowing the sequences of the polypeptides, the cDNAs encoding them can be generated by gene synthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0134">Furthermore, a method for the production of the antibody of the present invention is provided, comprising culturing of the host cell transformed with the DNA encoding said antibody under conditions that allow the synthesis of said antibody, and recovering said molecule from said culture. Preferably, said method provides an scFv antibody purified from <i>E. coli </i>inclusion bodies or from the <i>E. coli </i>periplasm, if the scFv construct used comprises a signal sequence that directs the polypeptide to the periplasm.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0135">Another aspect of the present invention is the use of the antibody provided by the present invention as a tool for diagnostics, preferably in vitro diagnostics, and/or as a pharmaceutical. This use is particularly preferred in the context of any TNF&#x3b1; related condition. The disease to be treated with an anti-TNF&#x3b1; scFv or fragment thereof is preferably a disease related to overexpression of TNF&#x3b1;. If overexpression of TNF&#x3b1; leads to an abnormal cellular function, an antibody that can bind and thus neutralize excess TNF&#x3b1; is an ideal pharmaceutical for the treatment of such disease, if said antibody can reach the place of TNF&#x3b1; excess. If this place is inside the cell, the antibody must be able to enter the cell. If this place is extracellular, the antibody must be able to reach the extracellular matrix in a tissue, i.e. it must cross at least the outermost cell layer of a tissue, which is usually the epithelial cell layer. In another embodiment of the present invention the antibody is able to penetrate the endothelium.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">IV. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Pharmaceutical Administration</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">A. Compositions and Administration</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0136">In most cases the antibody of the present invention will be used in a pharmaceutical composition, said pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one further compound. Preferably, this will be in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient. The excipient may be selected from the group comprising azone, benzalkonium chloride (BzCl), BL-7, BL-9, Brij 35, Brij 78, Brij 98, Brij 99, Polyoxyethylene-Polyoxypropylene 1800, sodium caprate, caprylic acid, cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorhexidine, cholate, castor oil, corn oil, cremophor-EL, DMSO, decamethonium bromide, deoxycholate, dextransulfate, EDTA, disodium EDETATE, ethanol, fusidate, glycocholate, lauryl sulfate, L-&#x3b1;-lysophosphatidylocholine, N-lauroylsarcosine, NMP, oleic acid, phospholipids, poly oxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, saponin, Tween 20, Tween 40, Tween 60, Tween 80, taurocholeate, taurodeoxycholate, tight junction opening peptides and peptide derivatives, tight junction opening proteins and protein derivatives. Preferably, the excipient is selected from the group comprising benzalkonium chloride, Tween 20, Tween 40, Tween 60, Tween 80, and chlorhexidine. It is also possible to use caprate. Such substances can work as enhancers of penetration.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0137">In most cases the pharmaceutical composition comprising the antibody of the present invention will be applied locally rather than systemically. The antibody of the present invention is particularly suitable for local application, as its scFv format is small, and its framework has physicochemical characteristics enabling it to penetrate epithelial tissue barriers. A local application is an application in a relatively restricted area such as it is the eye, the nasal cavity, the oral cavity, the intestinal tract, the skin, the mucosa of the mouth and the urogenital tract, e joints and joint spaces, the brain, the vertebra etc., where the application of a relatively small volume of sufficiently concentrated antibody is effective. On the other hand, topical application is an application to the surface of a body part.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0138">The preferred form of administration of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is by topical application; however, other forms are by inhalation, e.g. if the antibody is destined to penetrate the lung epithelium. Pulmonary delivery may be accomplished using an inhaler or nebulizer and a formulation comprising an aerosolizing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0139">For topical applications, the preferred locus is the eye. The antibody of the present invention is particularly suitable to penetrate the cornea, which mainly consists of three tissue layers, namely the epithelium, the stroma and the endothelium. Thus the antibody can be used for the treatment of many diseases of the eye.</p>

<p id="p-0152" num="0157">The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may include dendrimers. Examples of dendrimers are well-known in the art, and include TM polyamidoamine (PAMAM).</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">C. Formulations</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0158">In another embodiment, the formulation may be a slow, extended, or time release formulation, a carrier formulation such as microspheres, microcapsules, liposomes, etc., as known to one skilled in the art. Any of the above-mentioned delivery systems may be administered topically, intraocularly, subconjunctivally, or by implant to result in sustained release of the agent over a period of time. The formulation may be in the form of a vehicle, such as a micro- or macro-capsule or matrix of biocompatible polymers such as polycaprolactone, polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polyanhydrides, polylactide-co-glycolides, polyamino acids, polyethylene oxide, acrylic terminated polyethylene oxide, polyamides, polyethylenes, polyacrylonitriles, polyphosphazenes, poly(ortho esters), sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB), and other polymers such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,667,371; 6,613,355; 6,596,296; 6,413,536; 5,968,543; 4,079,038; 4,093,709; 4,131,648; 4,138,344; 4,180,646; 4,304,767; 4,946,931, each of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, or lipids that may be formulated as microspheres or liposomes. A microscopic or macroscopic formulation may be administered topically or through a needle, or may be implanted. Delayed or extended release properties may be provided through various formulations of the vehicle (coated or uncoated microsphere, coated or uncoated capsule, lipid or polymer components, unilamellar or multilamellar structure, and combinations of the above, etc.). The formulation and loading of microspheres, microcapsules, liposomes, etc. and their ocular implantation are standard techniques known by one skilled in the art, for example, the use a ganciclovir sustained-release implant to treat cytomegalovirus retinitis, disclosed in Vitreoretinal Surgical Techniques, Peyman et al., Eds. (Martin Dunitz, London 2001, chapter 45); Handbook of Pharmaceutical Controlled Release Technology, Wise, Ed. (Marcel Dekker, New York 2000), the relevant sections of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. For example, a sustained release intraocular implant may be inserted through the pars plana for implantation in the vitreous cavity. An intraocular injection may be into the vitreous (intravitreal), or under the conjunctiva (subconjunctival), or behind the eye (retrobulbar), or under the Capsule of Tenon (sub-Tenon), and may be in a depot form. The composition may be administered via a contact lens applied to the exterior surface of an eye, with the composition incorporated into the lens material (e.g., at manufacture, or contained in a lens solution). The composition may be administered via an intraocular lens (IOL) that is implanted in the eye. Implantable lenses include any IOL used to replace a patient's diseased lens following cataract surgery, including but not limited to those manufactured by Bausch and Lomb (Rochester N.Y.), Alcon (Fort Worth Tex.), Allergan (Irvine Calif.), and Advanced Medical Optics (Santa Ana Calif.). See also Degim, I. T and Celebi, N. (2007), Current Pharmaceutical Design, 13, 99-117]. When the lens is implanted within the lens capsule, the composition provides the desired effect to the eye. Concentrations suitable for implants (lenses and other types) and by contact lens administration may vary, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art. For example, an implant may be loaded with a high amount of agent, but formulated or regulated so that a required concentration within the above-described ranges is sustainedly released (e.g., slow release formulation).</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0159">It has been found that antibody concentrations normally achieved with scFvs in the range of up to 1 mg/ml are not quite effective in epithelial penetration unless additional penetration enhancers are added (WO0040262). The present invention provides antibodies that are highly soluble, so that pharmaceutical compositions comprising said antibody at higher concentrations, i.e. greater than about 2 mg/ml, preferably greater than about 5 mg/ml, most preferably greater than about 10 mg/ml can be prepared and used in effective treatment of the corresponding, antigen related disease.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0160">Hence, the present invention provides a method for the treatment of an antigen-related disease, wherein delivery of the antibody to the site of antigen-antibody interaction requires penetration of a tissue that comprises tight junctions, in particular an epithelium and/or an endothelium. An epithelium is a tissue composed of a layer of cells, and it lines both the outside (skin) and the inside (e.g. intestinum) of organisms. Epithelia also include the mucous membranes lining the inside of mouth and body cavities and comprise dead squamous epithelial cells, and epithelial cells lining the inside of the lungs, the gastrointestinal tract, and the reproductive and the urinary tracts. An endothelium is a layer of thin, flat cells that lines the interior surface of blood vessels and organs. In vasculature it forms an interface between circulating blood in the lumen and the rest of the vessel wall. Endothelial cells line the entire circulatory system, from the heart to the smallest capillary. In small blood vessels and capillaries, endothelial cells are often the only cell-type present. Endothelial cells also control the passage of materials into and out of the bloodstream. In some organs, there are highly differentiated endothelial cells to perform specialized &#x2018;filtering&#x2019; functions. Examples of such unique endothelial structures include the renal glomerulus and the blood-brain barrier. Endothelial tissue is a specialized type of epithelium tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0161">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the penetration of the cornea can be achieved. The corneal epithelium covers the front of the cornea and consists of several layers of cells, which renders penetration by an antibody even more difficult. The antibody of the present invention is preferably able to penetrate the entire cornea.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0162">An ideal drug for treatment of uveitis should cover four crucial characteristics: 1) Provide a fast onset of effects on acute symptoms. 2) Show comparable efficacy as compared with standard topical corticosteroids. 3) Show superior safety profile as compared with standard topical corticosteroids. 4) Have favourable pharmacokinetic properties allowing for topical application to the cornea as well as for intravitreal injection as compared with standard corticosteroids or standard monoclonal antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0163">A locally applied inhibitor of TNF&#x3b1;, comprising adequate pharmacokinetic properties can address all these aspects. The good penetration of the anti-TNF&#x3b1; scFv antibody ESBA105 into the anterior part of the eye combined with its high TNF&#x3b1;-neutralizing activity ultimately lead to intra-ocular concentrations, which are very well suitable for therapeutic efficacy for uveitis anterior. Taken into account that TNF&#x3b1; levels found in the diseased eye were 15 pg/ml and that ESBA105 concentrations measured were up to 40,000 ng/ml for in the anterior part (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and up to 125 ng/ml for vitreous part of the eye (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), we conclude that ESBA105 is not only suitable for the treatment of uveitis anterior, but also for the treatment of different forms of panuveitis like e.g. ocular Beh&#xe7;et's disease. The present invention thus provides an antibody for the treatment of ocular disorders by topical application to the eye, in particular for the treatment of any form of uveitis, Beh&#xe7;et's disease, retinitis, dry eye syndrome, glaucoma, Sj&#xf6;gren syndrome, diabetes mellitus (incl. diabetic neuropathy), scleritis, conjunctivitis and keratitis. Administration preferably occurs by eye drops, eye ointment, or from depot devices like contact lenses).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0164">In another preferred embodiment of the present invention the antibody must penetrate the intestinal epithelium.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0165">In the case of treatment in the lung, inhalation must be used to bring the antibody to apply the antibody of the present invention at the lung epithelium.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0166">In yet another aspect of the present invention, the antibody is used as a diagnostic tool.</p>

<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Production of scFvs</heading>
<p id="p-0166" num="0171">ScFv antibodies were produced via expression as inclusion bodies, followed by a refolding and a chromatography step. Three single-chain antibodies were produced. This includes two conventional scFvs, which presumably do not fulfill the criteria of being well soluble, particularly stable and monomeric. One of them is TB-wt (SEQ ID No: 14), which was constructed by linking the natural VL and VH sequences of the murine anti-TNF&#x3b1; monoclonal antibody Di62 (Doring et al., 1994). The other one is lucentis-scFv, which was constructed by linking the VL and VH sequences of the VEGF-specific Fab fragment ranibizumab (SEQ. ID. No:15). ESBA105 is an scFv, which carries the CDRs of Di62 and which reveals a Kd value in the nanomolar range for TNF&#x3b1;. Solubility, stability and monomeric behavior of ESBA105 were optimized by employing an scFv framework, which was selected by the so-called Quality Control system (Auf der Maur et al., 2004). The amino acid sequence of ESBA105 is disclosed in SEQ ID No. 13.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the elution profiles of ESBA105 (A), TB-wt (B) and lucentis-scFv (C) of the preparative gel filtration, which follows the refolding step. Whereas the profile for ESBA105 consists mainly of one sharp peak going up to 300 mAU (relative units for absorption), several broad peaks with maximal highs of 16 and 55 mAU, respectively, can be seen in the profiles of TB-wt and lucentis-scFv. This indicates that either the quality of the inclusion bodies and or the refolding process is much less efficient for TB-wt and lucentis-scFv as compared to ESBA105.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0173">Below, the production procedure is described in detail for ESBA105.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0174">Construction of Plasmid pGMP002 for Expression of ESBA105:</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0175">The ESBA105 coding sequence was ligated into the NcoI-HindIII sites of pET-24d(+) (Novagen, catalogue number 69752-3). Subsequently, the Bpu11021-NotI fragment of the resulting construct was removed by blunt end ligation after the sticky ends produced by Bpu11021 and NotI digestions were filled up by T4 polymerase reaction to produce pGMP003. pGMP002 was produced by removing the Bpu11021-NotI from pET-24d(+) directly.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0176">Expression of ESBA105 in <i>E. coli: </i></p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0177">For expression of ESBA105, <i>E. coli </i>BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) was transformed with the expression plasmid pGMP002. Glycerol stock cultures were prepared from single colonies, cultivated in M9 medium (Sambrook et. al, Molecular Cloning, A laboratory Manual) containing 1% glucose, 1 ml/l of a trace element solution (Wang and Lee, Biotechnol Bioeng 58:325-328) and 50 &#x3bc;g/ml kanamycin. Cells were grown overnight at 37&#xb0; C., glycerol was added to 20% and 1 ml aliquots were stored as glycerol stocks at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0178">For the first preculture, 50 ml of a synthetic defined medium (Korz et. al., J. Biotechnol. 1995, 39:59-65), containing 1% glucose, 1 ml/l of trace element solution and 50 &#x3bc;g/ml kanamycin, was inoculated with 1 ml of a glycerol stock. Preculture was grown overnight at 37&#xb0; C. and 200 rpm in a baffled shake flask. A second preculture with 250 ml of the same medium was inoculated with the first preculture and grown for additional three hours at 37&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0179">Bioreactor cultivations were performed in a 5 l bioreactor (BioFlo 110, New Brunswick Scientific), containing an initial volume of 3 l of the same synthetic medium used for precultures. Cultivation temperature was set to 37&#xb0; C. Culture pH was controlled at 7.0 by the addition of 25% ammonia water and 1 M phosphoric acid. The level of dissolved oxygen was maintained above 20% of the air saturation level by varying the pure oxygen percentage at an overall aeration rate of 4 l/min. The bioreactor was inoculated with the second preculture and operated in batch mode up to an OD<sub>600 </sub>of 10-12. Exponential glucose feeding was then started at a rate of 0.15 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>with a 50% glucose solution containing 10 g/l MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O and 5 ml/l trace element solution. After 16 h, protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG to 1 mM and exponential feeding was continued for 3 h. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4,600 rpm for 1 h.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0180">Inclusion Body Preparation:</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0181">For preparation of inclusion bodies, 1 kg of wet cell paste was resuspended in 5 l TBS buffer (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.3). 1 g of solid lysozyme was added and cell suspension was incubated for 30-60 min. For cell disruption, the suspension was passed two times through a high-pressure homogenizer (Niro Soavi, Panda 2K) at 1,000 bar. Disrupted cells are centrifuged for 1 h at 4,600 rpm and the resulting inclusion bodies were resuspended in 2 l TBS buffer, containing 0.5% LDAO (N&#x2014;,N-Dimethyldodecylamin-N-oxid, Fluka). The inclusion bodies were washed repeatedly until no significant residual protein was detected in the washing supernatant. Finally, inclusion bodies were washed twice with TBS-buffer without LDAO.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0182">Refolding of ESBA105:</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0183">Inclusion bodies were solubilized in the 10-fold volume of solubilization buffer containing 6 M guanidinium-HCl, 100 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA and 20 mM DTT at pH 8.0 and incubated overnight at room temperature. Solubilized protein was then refolded by 1:50 dilution into refolding buffer containing 3 M urea, 100 mM Tris and 2 mM each of cystein and cystine at pH 8.5. Refolding was continued for 24 h at room temperature. After refolding, precipitates were removed by depth filtration and the refolding solution was concentrated to 50% of the initial volume. The concentrated refolding solution was then dialyzed against the 4-fold volume of PBS buffer (50 mM Na-phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.5) and further concentrated to a protein concentration of approximately 1 mg/ml.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0184">Purification of ESBA105 by Chromatography:</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0185">ESBA105 was purified in two chromatography steps: gel filtration and cation exchange chromatography. All chromatography steps were operated by &#xc4;KTA purification systems (GE Healthcare).</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0186">For preparative gel filtration chromatography, a Sephadex S75 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) was used with PBS buffer (50 mM Na-phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.5) as running buffer. Collected ESBA105-fraction was eluted at approximately 185 ml retention volume as a single peak.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0187">Fractogel EMD SO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> (M) (Merck) was used as column resin for the second chromatography step. Resin was equilibrated with five column volumes equilibration buffer (50 mM Na-acetate, pH 5.5). ESBA105 peak fractions from gel filtration were diluted 10 fold with 50 mM Na-acetate pH 5.5 and then loaded onto the column with a flow rate of 5 ml/min. After loading, the column was washed with five column volumes equilibration buffer. A linear gradient from 0-35% Elution buffer (50 mM Na-acetate, 500 mM NaCl, pH 5.5) within 60 minutes and 5 ml/min was used for elution of ESBA105. The most prominent peak after elution was collected and identified as ESBA105. The collected ESBA105 fraction was finally dialyzed against PBS (50 mM Na-phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.5) and stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C.</p>

<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Stability of scFv During Storage</heading>
<p id="p-0185" num="0190">The stability of the scFv over time is an important feature in the context of a pharmaceutical. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an analysis of the ESBA105 scFv (lanes 1-6) and the QC15.2 scFv (lanes 7-12) that were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie after two weeks of storage at different temperature (&#x2212;80&#xb0; C.: lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) or 40&#xb0; C.: lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12) and concentrations (20 mg/ml: lanes 1, 2, 7 and 8; 10 mg/ml; lanes 3, 4, 9 and 10; 1 mg/ml: lanes 5, 6, 11 and 12). The antibodies remained stable over the entire ranges of temperature and at all tested concentrations, and no signs of degradation or aggregation were found.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0191">An antibody that is stable over a certain time should also retain its full activity. Therefore, we tested ESBA105 eight weeks after storage at 37&#xb0; C. or &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. in L929 assays for their activity. The result is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and no difference between the two temperatures could be seen.</p>
<heading id="h-0020" level="1">Example 4</heading>
<heading id="h-0021" level="1">Ex Vivo Penetration of ESBA105 into Whole Rabbit Eyes</heading>
<p id="p-0187" num="0192">The amount of ESBA105 penetrating into different compartments of whole rabbit eyes was tested under various conditions in an ex vivo setting. For these series of experiments, the rabbit eyes were placed on incubation test plates that have depressions on its surface. The depression contained the ESBA105 test solution and the rabbit eyes were placed on the test plates such that the cornea was in contact with the test solution. After an incubation time of 4 hours at 37&#xb0; C., the different eye compartments were analyzed for their ESBA105 content. For this analysis, a syringe was used to remove probes from the compartment of interest (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and the ESBA105 concentration of the probe was determined by ELISA.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0193">The following conditions were assessed with the experimental setup described above: ESBA105 was tested at concentrations of 1, 2, 5 and 10 mg/ml. The concentration of 1 mg/ml was furthermore tested in the presence of 0.5% capric acid. 0.5% of capric acid was previously shown by Thiel et al. (Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002 April; 128 (1):67-74) to enhance the penetration through cornea. When 1 mg/ml was administered in the presence of 0.5% capric acid, we measured a concentration of ESBA105 in the anterior part of the eye of about 40 &#x3bc;g/ml, which was about the same as compared to concentrations measured after administration of 10 mg/ml in the absence of capric acid (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Interestingly, when the results of these two administration modes were compared in the vitreous liquid, there were about 40 ng/ml measured for administration of 1 mg/ml with capric acid and about 125 ng/ml for 10 mg/ml without capric acid (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). In the absence of capric acid the concentrations measured in the two compartments revealed a clear dependence on the applied concentrations of 1, 2, 5 and 10 mg/ml (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0194">The eye incubation test plates were pre-incubated with blocking buffer (5% low fat milk powder in PBS, pH 7.4) over night at 4&#xb0; C. On the next day the plates were washed with PBS and afterwards dried by incubating at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes. The wells of the dried plates were filled with 125 &#x3bc;l of test solution each and isolated rabbit eyes were placed to the wells in a manner that only the cornea was in contact with the test solution. After incubation at 37&#xb0; C. and 100% humidity for 4 hours, the eyes were washed for 3 hours with PBS. Paracenthesis was carried out using a 25 G needle for the anterior eye chamber and a 22 G needle for the vitreous body.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0195">The concentration of ESBA105 in the probes was determined by ELISA as follows: The probes were centrifuged with a bench-microfuge at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. The probes from the anterior compartment were diluted 1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000, the probes from the vitreous compartment were diluted 1:5 in TBST (TBS supplemented with 0.005% Tween) containing 0.5% low fat milk powder (hereinafter referred to as diluting solution) for ELISA testing.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0196">ELISA 96 well plates (Nunc Maxisorb; catalogue number 442404) were coated with 0.5 &#x3bc;g/ml human TNF&#x3b1; over night at 4&#xb0; C. On the next day the plates were washed 3 times with TBST at room temperature and incubated with 300 &#x3bc;l blocking buffer (5% low fat milk powder in TBST) per well for 60 min at room temperature on a shaker (500-600 rpm). After the blocking step the plates were washed 3 times with TBST before 50 &#x3bc;l of diluted probes were added to each well and the plates were incubated on a shaker (500-600 rpm) for 90 minutes at room temperature. After this incubation step the plates were washed 3 times with TBST, before 50 &#x3bc;l of a 1:10,000 solution (diluted in diluting solution) of the secondary antibody AKA3A-biotinylated were added to each well. AKA3A-biotinylated is a polyclonal rabbit anti-ESBA105 antibody, which was freshly biotinylated (according to standard biotinylation protocols). After 90 minutes of incubation on a shaker (500-600 rpm) at room temperature, the plates were washed 3 times with TBST, before 50 &#x3bc;l of a 1:2000 dilution (diluted in diluting solution) of streptavidin-coupled horseradish peroxidase (streptavidin-polyHRP40, 1 mg/ml; SDT; #SP40C) was added. After 60 minutes of incubation on a shaker (500-600 rpm) at room temperature, the plates were washed 3 times with TBST and 2 times with ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) activity was detected upon addition of 50 &#x3bc;l BM Blue POD substrate (Roche Diagnostics, catalogue number 1484281) to each well. After 6-12 minutes of incubation at room temperature in the dark the HPR reaction was stopped by addition of 50 &#x3bc;l 1 M HCl to each well. The HPR reaction was quantified by spectrometric measurement at 450 nm in a TECAN Genios reader.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0197">The ESBA105 concentration of the probes was finally determined by comparison to a standard curve, which was produced in parallel.</p>

<heading id="h-0023" level="1">Penetration Through Caco-2 Cell Monolayers by ESBA105</heading>
<p id="p-0193" num="0198">Human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells were seeded on permeable supports of a 24-transwell plate and cultivated during 21 days at 37&#xb0; C. in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere to allow the formation of tight monolayers. Before performing the permeability assay the transepithelial electrical resistance was measured in each well to verify the integrity of the monolayers. Caco-2 monolayers were then washed three times with a saline solution (HBSS) and a mixture containing either 1 &#x3bc;M of ESBA105 with or without caprate, or assay medium alone was added to the upper compartment of the transwells as a control. After defined time points the content of the lower compartments was collected and replaced by fresh assay medium. Samples collected were subsequently analyzed by quantitative ELISA to determine the amount of ESBA105 that penetrated through the Caco-2 epithelial monolayer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</p>
<heading id="h-0024" level="1">Example 6</heading>
<heading id="h-0025" level="1">Penetration Through Mouse Jejunum</heading>
<p id="p-0194" num="0199">Approximately 5 cm of mouse jejunum were excised immediately after animal euthanasia and were incubated in oxygen saturated ringer-krebs buffer and flushed three times with ringer-krebs buffer. A section of 3.5 cm was ligated with surgical silk and filled with 200 mcl antibody mixture, containing 1 mg/ml of each antibody format (Infliximab and ESBA105). Approximately 1 cm distal of the everted sac compartment a second ligation was added to secure tightness of the compartment. Everted sacs were placed into a beaker glass containing 10 ml of oxygen saturated ringer-krebs buffer such that only first ligations came in touch with the buffer. Protease inhibitors were added to this receptor compartment to prevent degradation of antibodies. In order to determine amount of each antibody that penetrated through intestinal tissue, 200 mcl probes were taken from the receptor compartment after defined time points and were subsequently analyzed by quantitative ELISA.</p>
<heading id="h-0026" level="1">Example 7</heading>
<heading id="h-0027" level="1">Topical Application of a Soluble Antigen-Binding Polypeptide</heading>
<p id="p-0195" num="0200">The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the topical application of a soluble antigen-binding polypeptide, ESBA105, in rabbit eyes in vivo were studied. Four different formulations were prepared. The first formulation (referred to herein as &#x201c;B15&#x201d;) was comprised of 9.6 mg/ml of ESBA105 in 0.15M phosphate buffer at pH 6. The second formulation (referred to herein as &#x201c;B16&#x201d;) was comprised of 10.3 mg/ml of ESBA105 and 0.01% (w/v) chlorhexidine in 0.15M sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6. The first control (referred to herein as &#x201c;B15-0&#x201d;) was comprised of 0.15M sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6. The second control (referred to herein as &#x201c;B16-0&#x201d;) was comprised of 0.01% (w/v) chlorhexidine in 0.15M sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6. All formulations were sterilized prior to use, and stored at 4&#xb0; C. As used herein, &#x201c;OTT&#x201d; indicates no treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0201">To study the pharmacodynamics of ESBA105 in the eye, 6 rabbits were used for each formulation. The formulation was tested in both eyes of the rabbits. Two rabbits (4 eyes) were used for each formulation without antibody fragments, and two rabbits (4 eyes) were used as na&#xef;ve controls. A total of 18 rabbits were used for this study.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0202">The formulations were applied locally to the eyes over the course of six days. Rabbits were treated five times a day, at hour seven, hour ten, hour thirteen, hour seventeen, and hour twenty. On the day of sacrifice, rabbits were treated twice, at hour seven, and hour ten, and sacrificed one hour after the last application.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0203">The eyes were evaluated at day one, day three, and day six. Two rabbits per formulation were used to gather pharmacokinetic data for each time point. An aqueous humour sample and a serum sample were taken at day one and day three. At day six, an aqueous humour sample, and a serum sample were taken and the eyes of the rabbits were dissected into tissues in order to study the distribution of the antibody fragment in the different eye tissues. The results of this study are graphically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref><i>a </i>through <b>11</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0204">Additional studies were performed to study the solubility, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of ESBA105. The results are recorded in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 through 16</figref>. As can be seen from these figures, ESBA105 has been shown to penetrate through corneal tissue layers in rabbits and pigs. ESBA105 accumulates in the vitreous and has a local half time of about 25 hours. The local half time of ESBA105 in the anterior chamber is significantly lower than in the vitreous. Systemic exposure upon topical treatment is extremely low, e.g., approximately 2% of highest local concentration. Further, based on the rabbit topical experiment therapeutic drug levels (approximately 16,000 fold about TNF) can be reached with as little as five topical drops per day. Therefore, topical application of TNF inhibitory scFv antibody fragments could be an effective therapy in diseases located in more posterior segments of the eye, e.g., vitreous, and retina.</p>

<heading id="h-0029" level="1">Dose Response in the Rat Acute Monoarthritis Model</heading>
<p id="p-0200" num="0205">To study the dose response, ESBA105 was administered as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. As a comparison, Remicade&#xae; (infliximab) was administered as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. For this experiment, TNF&#x3b1; was administered with three different dosages (156 &#x3bc;g, 45 &#x3bc;g, or 11 &#x3bc;g) of ESBA105 or infliximab.

<p id="p-0201" num="0206">To determine the maximal systemic exposure and local drug levels during one day of topical administration, one drop every 20 minutes was administered over a period of 10 hours. Drug levels were measured by ELISA in aqueous, vitreous and serum. ESBA105 was formulated as 10 mg/ml in PBS, pH 6.5. For each drop, 30 mcl was applied to the top of the pupil, and the eye lids were then squeezed to remove excess fluid.

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Disclosed herein are peptides and peptide analogs with multiple amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains that promote lipid efflux from cells via an ABCA1-dependent pathway, as well as peptides that activate lipoprotein lipase, and compositions comprising such peptides or combinations thereof. Also provided herein are methods of using multi-domain amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical peptides or peptide analogs to treat or inhibit dyslipidemic disorders. Methods for identifying non-cytotoxic peptides that promote ABCA1-dependent lipid efflux from cells and activate lipoprotein lipase within cells are also disclosed herein.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to peptides or peptide analogs with multiple amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains that promote lipid efflux from cells via an ABCA1-dependent pathway and activate lipoprotein lipase. The disclosure further relates to methods for characterizing multi-domain amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical peptides that promote lipid efflux from cells and activate lipoprotein lipase in cells. Multi-domain amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical peptides that promote lipid efflux from cells via an ABCA1-dependent pathway in a substantially non-cytotoxic manner (e.g., without causing significant hypertriglyceridemia) are useful in the treatment and prevention of dyslipidemic and vascular disorders.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Clearance of excess cholesterol from cells by high density lipoproteins (HDL) is facilitated by the interaction of HDL apolipoprotein with cell-surface binding sites or receptors (Mendez et al., <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>94:1698-1705, 1994), such as ABCA1 (Oram and Yokoyama, <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>37:2473-2491, 1996). ABCA1 is a member of the ATP binding cassette transporter family (Dean and Chimini., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>42:1007-1017, 2001) and is expressed by many cell types (Langmann et al., <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </i>257:29-33, 1999). Mutations in the ABCA1 transporter lead to Tangier disease, which is characterized by the accumulation of excess cellular cholesterol, low levels of HDL and an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (Rust et al., <i>Nat. Genet. </i>22:352-355, 1999; Bodzioch et al., <i>Nat. Genet. </i>22:347-351, 1999; Brooks-Wilson et al., <i>Nat. Genet. </i>22:336-345, 1999; Remaley et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>96:12685-12690, 1999; and Lawn et al., <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>104:R25-R31, 1999). Fibroblasts from Tangier disease patients are defective in the initial step of cholesterol and phospholipid efflux to extracellular apolipoproteins (Francis et al., <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>96:78-87, 1995 and Remaley et al., <i>Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. </i>17:1813-1821, 1997).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Research has demonstrated an inverse correlation between the occurrence of atherosclerosis events and levels of HDL and its most abundant protein constituent, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) (Panagotopulos et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>277:39477-39484, 2002). ApoA-I has been shown to promote lipid efflux from ABCA1-transfected cells (Wang et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>275:33053-33058, 2000; Hamon et al., <i>Nat. Cell Biol. </i>2:399-406, 2000; and Remaley et al., <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </i>280:818-823, 2001). However, the nature of the interaction between apoA-I and ABCA1 is not fully understood. Several other exchangeable-type apolipoproteins have also been shown to efflux lipid from ABCA1-transfected cells (Remaley et al., <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </i>280:818-823, 2001). Although the exchangeable-type apolipoproteins do not share a similar primary amino acid sequence, they all contain amphipathic helices, a structural motif known to facilitate the interaction of proteins with lipids (Segrest et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>33:141-166, 1992 and Anantharamaiah et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>260:10248-10255, 1985). Animal experiments have shown that intravenous injections of apoA-I or its variant, apoA-I Milano (which has a cysteine substitution at position 173 for arginine), produced significant regression of atherosclerosis (Rubin et al., <i>Nature </i>353:265-267, 1991 and Nissen et al., <i>JAMA </i>290:2292-2300, 2003). These results make apoA-1, or derivatives thereof, attractive as potential therapeutic compounds in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Short synthetic peptide mimics of apolipoproteins have been used as a model for studying physical and biological properties of apolipoproteins (see, e.g., Fukushima et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>101:3703-3704, 1980; Kanellis et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>255:11464-11472, 1980; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,643,988, and 6,376,464). These include, for instance, single helices taken from native apolipoproteins, synthetic amphipathic alpha helices (Kanellis et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>255:11464-11472, 1980), and derivatives thereof. Examples of short synthetic amphipathic helical peptides have been shown to promote lipid efflux and inhibit atherosclerosis (Garber et al, <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>42:545-552, 2001; Navab et al., <i>Circulation </i>105:290-292, 2002; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,156,727). However, while some of these peptides exhibit beneficial effects in preventing atherosclerosis, they are also potentially cytotoxic (Remaley et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>44:828-836, 2003). It is believed that the cytotoxicity is caused by non-specific, ABCA1-independent lipid efflux from cells (Remaley et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>44:828-836, 2003). Therefore, there exists a need for non-cytotoxic synthetic peptide mimics of apolipoproteins that promote specific lipid efflux from cells by an ABCA1-dependent pathway for use in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Isolated peptides and peptide analogs including peptides with multiple amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains that promote lipid efflux from cells via an ABCA1-dependent pathway have been identified and are described herein. In various embodiments, a first amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain exhibits higher lipid affinity relative to a second amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain in the same peptide. In one example, the multi-domain peptide includes two amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains and the peptide comprises an amino acid sequence as set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 3-45.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also disclosed herein are isolated peptides and peptide analogs capable of promoting lipid efflux from cells by an ABCA1-dependent pathway which include a domain capable of activating lipoprotein lipase. In one embodiment, a peptide comprises a first domain that is an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain that promotes lipid efflux from cells by an ABCA1-dependent pathway, and a second domain including an apoC-II protein, or a variant or fragment thereof that retains a lipoprotein lipase-activating property. For example, in some instances the first domain is an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain with a hydrophobic moment score (Eisenberg scale; 100 degree-alpha helix) per residue of about 0.34 to about 0.60 and the second domain comprises an ApoC-II protein with an amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 63-69. In certain embodiments, the peptide or peptide analog includes an amino acid sequence as set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 70-75. In other embodiments, these domains are provided in a single preparation (or mixture or combination of preparations), but the domains are not all covalently linked to each other; e.g., the domain capable of activating lipoprotein lipase is on a different peptide or protein than the domain(s) capable of promoting lipid efflux from cells by an ABAC1-dependent pathway.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also described herein is a method of treating dyslipidemic and vascular disorders in a subject, including administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of the isolated multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs described herein. Dyslipidemic and vascular disorders amenable to treatment with the isolated multi-domain peptides disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, hyperlipidemia, hyperlipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, HDL deficiency, apoA-I deficiency, coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, thrombotic stroke, peripheral vascular disease, restenosis, acute coronary syndrome, reperfusion myocardial injury, vasculitis, inflammation, or combinations of two or more thereof. In various embodiments, a peptide (or mixture of peptides) including a first domain with ABCA-1 dependent lipid efflux activity and a second domain with lipoprotein lipase activity is administered at a therapeutically effective concentration to prevent, inhibit or reduce a dyslipidemic or vascular disorder. In some embodiments, one of the disclosed peptides comprising an amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 70-75 is administered at a therapeutically effective concentration to prevent, inhibit or reduce a dylipidemic or vascular disorder. In other embodiments, one of the disclosed peptides including ABCA-1 dependent lipid efflux activity, such as a peptide comprising an amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 3-45, is administered at a therapeutically effective concentration in combination with a therapeutically effective concentration of a lipoprotein lipase activator, such as a peptide comprising an amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs:63-69, to prevent, inhibit or reduce a dylipidemic or vascular disorder. Optionally, such peptides are administered in combination with a peptide (or analog) that activates lipoprotein lipase. Representative lipoprotein lipase activating peptides are described.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A method for identifying substantially non-cytotoxic peptides that promotes ABCA1-dependent lipid efflux from cells and/or are capable of activating lipoprotein lipase is also described. In various embodiments, the method includes performing one of more cytotoxicity tests, one or more lipid efflux tests, and one or more lipoprotein lipase activity tests on ABCA1/liproprotein lipase-expressing and non-ABCA1/lipoprotein lipase-expressing cells, thereby identifying one or more substantially non-cytotoxic peptides that promote ABCA1-dependent lipid efflux from cells and are capable of activating lipoprotein lipase in such cells. Example peptides for use in methods for identifying substantially non-cytotoxic peptides that promote ABCA1-dependent efflux from cells include peptides that contain two or more domains, such as an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain that promotes lipid efflux from cells by an ABCA1-dependent pathway, and a ApoC-II protein domain, or a variant or fragment thereof that retains a lipoprotein lipase-activating property.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a graph illustrating 5A-POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine peptide-mediated alterations in plasma cholesterol after IV infusion of increasing doses of 5A peptide in wild-type mice over 24 hours. Increasing doses of the peptide resulted in increased plasma HDL as result of ABCA-1 mediated efflux.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a graph illustrating atherosclerosis measurement in ApoE KO mice treated for 12 weeks with 5A peptide versus POPC control. A significant difference of 29% was observed in female mice that received 30 mg/kg of peptide. This dose showed only modest changes in cholesterol efflux to plasma (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), suggesting that higher doses of the peptide could lead to further reduction and possibly regression of plaques.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a series of graphs illustrating changes in liver enzymes, hemolytic parameter, kidney function and glucose levels in wild-type mice receiving increasing doses of the 5A peptide. No significant changes were observed in the measured parameters, including weight during the study. Some of the parameters did show improvement compared to control and baseline.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a graph illustrating the change in plasma triglycerides after intravenous (IV) infusion of increasing doses of 5A-POPC peptide over 24 hours, after over night fasting in wild-type mice. The increasing doses of the 5A-POPC peptide led to a proportional increase in triglyceride levels, up to 3 fold the baseline value. This effect has also been observed after the injection of the native ApoA-I lipoprotein.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a graph illustrating the change in plasma triglycerides after IV infusion of increasing doses of 5A-POPC peptide over 24 hours, in non-fasting mice. Unlike a maximal 3 fold increase in plasma triglycerides, when mice were not fasting an increase of up to 20 times was observed. No signs of toxicity were observed in mice receiving up to 240 mg/kg of peptide during the study.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a graph illustrating triglyceride synthesis in mice after lipase inhibition by Triton-WR 1339. Increasing doses of the 5A peptide led to no significant changes in triglycerides synthesis suggesting that the hypertriglyceridemia observed after 5A injection resulted from decreased catabolism of ApoB-containing lipoproteins.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a graph illustrating in vitro activity of lipoprotein lipase at increasing doses of 5A peptide. Compared to baseline, the activity of LPL decreased dramatically as the concentration of 5A-POPC peptide increased.</p>

Hypertriglyceridemia was induced in C57B1/6 mice by a 2 mg (60 mg/kg) bolus intravenous (IV) injection of free 5A peptide (&#x394;). When 1 mg (30 mg/kg) of the 18A-C-II peptide was co-injected with free 5A peptide (X), the increase in plasma triglycerides was significantly halted. In addition, a single IV dose of 1 mg of the 18A-C-II:POPC peptide lowered the plasma triglyceride levels in normal C57B1 mice (&#x25a1;) compared to saline (&#x22c4;).</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">II. Terms</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0059">Unless otherwise noted, technical terms are used according to conventional usage. Definitions of common terms in molecular biology may be found in Benjamin Lewin, <i>Genes VII</i>, published by Oxford University Press, 2000 (ISBN 019879276X); Kendrew et al. (eds.), <i>The Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology</i>, published by Blackwell Publishers, 1994 (ISBN 0632021829); and Robert A. Meyers (ed.), <i>Molecular Biology and Biotechnology: a Comprehensive Desk Reference</i>, published by Wiley, John &#x26; Sons, Inc., 1995 (ISBN 0471186341); and other similar references.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0060">As used herein, the singular terms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless context clearly indicates otherwise. Similarly, the word &#x201c;or&#x201d; is intended to include &#x201c;and&#x201d; unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Also, as used herein, the term &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; means &#x201c;includes.&#x201d; Hence &#x201c;comprising A or B&#x201d; means including A, B, or A and B. It is further to be understood that all base sizes or amino acid sizes, and all molecular weight or molecular mass values, given for nucleic acids or polypeptides are approximate, and are provided for description. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including explanations of terms, will control. The materials, methods and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0061">In order to facilitate review of the various embodiments of this disclosure, the following explanations of specific terms are provided:</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0062">Alkane: A type of hydrocarbon, in which the molecule has the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms, and therefore has no double bonds (i.e., they are saturated). The generic formula for acyclic alkanes, also known as aliphatic hydrocarbons is C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>; the simplest possible alkane is methane (CH<sub>4</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0063">Alkyl group: refers to a branched or unbranched saturated hydrocarbon group of 1 to 24 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, decyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, eicosyl, tetracosyl and the like. A &#x201c;lower alkyl&#x201d; group is a saturated branched or unbranched hydrocarbon having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0064">Amphipathic: An amphipathic molecule contains both hydrophobic (non-polar) and hydrophilic (polar) groups. The hydrophobic group can be an alkyl group, such as a long carbon chain, for example, with the formula: CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>, (where n is generally greater than or equal to about 4 to about 16). Such carbon chains also optionally comprise one or more branches, wherein a hydrogen is replaced with an aliphatic moiety, such as an alkyl group. A hydrophobic group also can comprise an aryl group. The hydrophilic group can be one or more of the following: an ionic molecule, such as an anionic molecule (e.g., a fatty acid, a sulfate or a sulfonate) or a cationic molecule, an amphoteric molecule (e.g., a phospholipid), or a non-ionic molecule (e.g., a small polymer).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0065">One example of an amphipathic molecule is an amphipathic peptide. An amphipathic peptide can also be described as a helical peptide that has hydrophilic amino acid residues on one face of the helix and hydrophobic amino acid residues on the opposite face. Optionally, peptides described herein will form amphipathic helices in a physiological environment, such as for instance in the presence of lipid or a lipid interface.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0066">Analog, derivative or mimetic: An analog is a molecule that differs in chemical structure from a parent compound, for example a homolog (differing by an increment in the chemical structure, such as a difference in the length of an alkyl chain), a molecular fragment, a structure that differs by one or more functional groups, a change in ionization. Structural analogs are often found using quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR), with techniques such as those disclosed in Remington (<i>The Science and Practice of Pharmacology, </i>19th Edition (1995), chapter 28). A derivative is a biologically active molecule derived from the base structure. A mimetic is a molecule that mimics the activity of another molecule, such as a biologically active molecule. Biologically active molecules can include chemical structures that mimic the biological activities of a compound.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0067">Animal: Living multi-cellular vertebrate organisms, a category that includes, for example, mammals and birds. The term mammal includes both human and non-human mammals. Similarly, the term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; includes both human and veterinary subjects, for example, humans, non-human primates, dogs, cats, horses, and cows.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0068">Antibody: A protein (or protein complex) that includes one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes or fragments of immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0069">The basic immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit is generally a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one &#x201c;light&#x201d; (about 25 kDa) and one &#x201c;heavy&#x201d; (about 50-70 kDa) chain. The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms &#x201c;variable light chain&#x201d; (V<sub>L</sub>) and &#x201c;variable heavy chain&#x201d; (V<sub>H</sub>) refer, respectively, to these light and heavy chains.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0070">As used herein, the term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; includes intact immunoglobulins as well as a number of well-characterized fragments. For instance, Fabs, Fvs, and single-chain Fvs (SCFvs) that bind to target protein (or epitope within a protein or fusion protein) would also be specific binding agents for that protein (or epitope). These antibody fragments are as follows: (1) Fab, the fragment which contains a monovalent antigen-binding fragment of an antibody molecule produced by digestion of whole antibody with the enzyme papain to yield an intact light chain and a portion of one heavy chain; (2) Fab&#x2032;, the fragment of an antibody molecule obtained by treating whole antibody with pepsin, followed by reduction, to yield an intact light chain and a portion of the heavy chain; two Fab&#x2032; fragments are obtained per antibody molecule; (3) (Fab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, the fragment of the antibody obtained by treating whole antibody with the enzyme pepsin without subsequent reduction; (4) F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, a dimer of two Fab&#x2032; fragments held together by two disulfide bonds; (5) Fv, a genetically engineered fragment containing the variable region of the light chain and the variable region of the heavy chain expressed as two chains; and (6) single chain antibody, a genetically engineered molecule containing the variable region of the light chain, the variable region of the heavy chain, linked by a suitable polypeptide linker as a genetically fused single chain molecule. Methods of making these fragments are routine (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, <i>Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual</i>, CSHL, New York, 1999).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0071">Antibodies for use in the methods and compositions of this disclosure can be monoclonal or polyclonal. Merely by way of example, monoclonal antibodies can be prepared from murine hybridomas according to the classical method of Kohler and Milstein (<i>Nature </i>256:495-97, 1975) or derivative methods thereof. Detailed procedures for monoclonal antibody production are described in Harlow and Lane, <i>Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual</i>, CSHL, New York, 1999.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0072">Apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II): A 79 amino acid protein, which plays a role in plasma lipid metabolism as an activator of lipoprotein lipase (LPL). This protein includes three amphipathic helices: helix 1, residues 16-38; helix 2, residues 45-58; and helix 3, residues 64-74. The lipase-activating region of apoC-II has previously been localized to the C-terminal domain of the sequence, from about residue 56, whereas the N-terminal domain (residues 1-50) of the sequence is involved in lipid binding.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0073">In particular examples, apoC-II protein, fragment or variant thereof is capable of activating lipoprotein lipase. For example, an apoC-II protein, fragment or variant thereof is administered with apoA-1 or peptide mimics thereof to prevent, reduce or inhibit hypertriglyceridemia. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term apoC-II includes any apoC-II gene, cDNA, mRNA, or protein from any organism and is capable of activating lipoprotein lipase.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0074">Nucleic acid and protein sequences for apoC-II are publicly available. For example, GenBank Accession No. NM<sub>&#x2014;</sub>009695 (human) discloses an apoC-II nucleic acid sequence, and GenBank Accession Nos. AAH05348 (human), NP<sub>&#x2014;</sub>001078821 (rat), NP<sub>&#x2014;</sub>001095850 (bovine), and NP<sub>&#x2014;</sub>033825 (mouse) disclose apoC-II protein sequences, all of which are incorporated by reference as provided by GenBank on Mar. 31, 2008.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0075">In one example, apoC-II includes a full-length wild-type (or native) sequence. In other examples, apoC-II includes fragments of a wild-type (or native) sequence. In certain examples, apoC-II fragments include at least residues 51 to 79, such as 56 to 79, 59 to 79, or 61 to 79 of apoC-II.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0076">In some examples, apoC-II variants include 19 amino acids with tyrosine at position 3, Ile at position 6, Asp at position 9, and Gln at position 10. In some examples, apoC-II has at least 20% sequence identity, for example, at least 25%, 30%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 98% sequence identity to human apoC-II residues 59 to 79.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0077">Domain: A domain of a protein is a part of a protein that shares common structural, physiochemical and functional features; for example hydrophobic, polar, globular, helical domains or properties, for example a DNA binding domain, an ATP binding domain, lipoprotein lipase activating domain, and the like. In a particular example, a peptide includes a first domain and a second domain (though they can occur in any order) in which the first domain is capable of promoting lipid efflux and the second domain is capable of activating lipoprotein lipase. For example, the first domain is an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain which has a high hydrophobic moment and the second domain is an apoC-II protein, variant, or fragment thereof that is capable of activating lipoprotein lipase.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0078">Dyslipidemic disorder: A disorder associated with any altered amount of any or all of the lipids or lipoproteins in the blood. Dyslipidemic disorders include, for example, hyperlipidemia, hyperlipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, HDL deficiency, apoA-I deficiency, and cardiovascular disease (i.e., coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis and restenosis).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0079">Efflux: The process of flowing out. As applied to the results described herein, lipid efflux refers to a process whereby lipid, such as cholesterol and phospholipid, is complexed with an acceptor, such as an apolipoprotein or apolipoprotein peptide mimic, and removed from vesicles or cells. &#x201c;ABCA1-dependent lipid efflux&#x201d; (or lipid efflux by an &#x201c;ABCA1-dependent pathway&#x201d;) refers to a process whereby apolipoproteins or peptide mimics of apolipoproteins bind to a cell and efflux lipid from the cell by a process that is facilitated by the ABCA1 transporter.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0080">Helix: The molecular conformation of a spiral nature, generated by regularly repeating rotations around the backbone bonds of a macromolecule.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0081">Hydrophobic: A hydrophobic (or lipophilic) group is electrically neutral and nonpolar, and thus prefers other neutral and nonpolar solvents or molecular environments. Examples of hydrophobic molecules include alkanes, oils and fats.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0082">Hydrophobic moment (&#x3bc;<sub>H</sub>): One measure of the degree of amphipathicity (i.e., the degree of asymmetry of hydrophobicity) in a peptide or other molecule; it is the vectorial sum of all the hydrophobicity indices for a peptide, divided by the number of residues. Thus, hydrophobic moment is the hydrophobicity of a peptide measured for different angles of rotation per amino acid residue. Methods for calculating &#x3bc;<sub>H </sub>for a particular peptide sequence are well-known in the art, and are described, for example, in Eisenberg et al., <i>Faraday Symp. Chem. Soc. </i>17:109-120, 1982; Eisenberg et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>179:125-142, 1984; and Kyte &#x26; Doolittle, <i>J. Mol. Biol., </i>157: 105-132, 1982. The actual &#x3bc;<sub>H </sub>obtained for a particular peptide will depend on the type and total number of amino acid residues composing the peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0083">The amphipathicities of peptides of different lengths can be directly compared by way of the mean hydrophobic moment. The mean hydrophobic moment can be obtained by dividing p<sub>H </sub>by the number of residues in the helix.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0084">The relative hydrophobic moment (&#x3bc;Hrel) of a peptide is its hydrophobic moment relative to that of a perfectly amphipathic peptide. This measurement provides insight into the amphipathicity using different scales. For example, a value of 0.5 indicates that the peptide has about 50% of the maximum possible amphipathicity. For the CCS scale, the relative hydrophobic moment is calculated by creating a peptide made up only of Phe (Hi=+10) and Arg (Hi=&#x2212;10), and placing them so as to obtain perfectly segregated hydrophobic/hydrophilic sectors on the Edmundson projection. For the K&#x26;D and Eisenberg scales, Ile and Arg are used. For &#x3b1;-helical peptides (projection angle=100&#xb0;, an 18 residue peptide with 9 Arg, 9 Phe/Ile is used. This results in &#x3bc;Hmax of 6.3, 2.8 and 0.83 for the CCS, K&#x26;D and Eisenberg scales, respectively. Table 1 provides the hydrophobicity values for the various amino acid residues using the various hydrophobicity scales.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0086">Peptide analysis tool programs (including programs available on the internal can be used to calculate hydrophobic moment of amphipathic sequences. See, for instance, the peptide sequence analysis tool created by Alex Tossi and Luca Sandri available on the World Wide Web (www) at bbcm.univ.trieste.it/&#x2dc;tossi/HydroCalc/HydroMCalc.html (maintained by the University of Trieste, Italy). This tool is also discussed in Tossi et al. (&#x201c;New Consensus hydrophobicity scale extended to non-proteinogenic amino acids&#x201d;, PEPTIDES 2002<i>, Proc. of </i>27<sup>th </sup><i>European Peptide Symposium</i>, Sorrento, 2002), incorporated herein by reference. In particular, this tool utilizes a Java applet that calculates the mean hydrophobicity, the mean hydrophobic moment and the relative hydrophobic moment for peptides using a selected scale and a selected projection angle; this program is known as HydroMCalc.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0087">Ordinary skilled artisans will recognize other ways in which hydrophobic moment and other comparative measurements of amphipathicity can be calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0088">Hydrophilic: A hydrophilic (or lipophobic) group is electrically polarized and capable of H-bonding, enabling it to dissolve more readily in water than in oil or other &#x201c;non-polar&#x201d; solvents.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0089">Implant: A support device. For example, an implant is a device that is employed to enhance and support existing passages, channels, and conduits such as the lumen of a blood vessel. In an example, an implant is an endovascular support. In a particular example, an implant is a stent. In one example, an implant is effective to maintain a vessel open. In the present disclosure, an implant can be coated with or impregnated with one or more of the disclosed peptides to assist with the treatment of a dyslipidemic or vascular disorder.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0090">Inhibiting or treating a disease: Inhibiting the full development of a disease, disorder or condition, for example, in a subject who is at risk for a disease such as atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. &#x201c;Treatment&#x201d; refers to a therapeutic intervention that ameliorates a sign or symptom of a disease or pathological condition after it has begun to develop. As used herein, the term &#x201c;ameliorating,&#x201d; with reference to a disease, pathological condition or symptom, refers to any observable beneficial effect of the treatment. The beneficial effect can be evidenced, for example, by a delayed onset of clinical symptoms of the disease in a susceptible subject, a reduction in severity of some or all clinical symptoms of the disease, a slower progression of the disease, a reduction in the number of relapses of the disease, an improvement in the overall health or well-being of the subject, or by other parameters well known in the art that are specific to the particular disease.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0091">Isolated/purified: An &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; or &#x201c;purified&#x201d; biological component (such as a nucleic acid, peptide or protein) has been substantially separated, produced apart from, or purified away from other biological components in the cell of the organism in which the component naturally occurs, that is, other chromosomal and extrachromosomal DNA and RNA, and proteins. Nucleic acids, peptides and proteins that have been &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; thus include nucleic acids and proteins purified by standard purification methods. The term also embraces nucleic acids, peptides and proteins prepared by recombinant expression in a host cell as well as chemically synthesized nucleic acids or proteins. The term &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; or &#x201c;purified&#x201d; does not require absolute purity; rather, it is intended as a relative term. Thus, for example, an isolated biological component is one in which the biological component is more enriched than the biological component is in its natural environment within a cell. Preferably, a preparation is purified such that the biological component represents at least 50%, such as at least 70%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or greater of the total biological component content of the preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0092">Label: A detectable compound or composition that is conjugated directly or indirectly to another molecule to facilitate detection of that molecule. Specific, non-limiting examples of labels include fluorescent tags, enzymatic linkages, and radioactive isotopes.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0093">Linker: A molecule that joins two other molecules, either covalently, or through ionic, van der Waals or hydrogen bonds. In particular examples, a linker comprises glycine, proline or alanine. In one specific example, the linker is a sequence of one or more prolines.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0094">Lipid: A class of water-insoluble, or partially water insoluble, oily or greasy organic substances, that are extractable from cells and tissues by nonpolar solvents, such as chloroform or ether. Types of lipids include triglycerides (i.e., natural fats and oils composed of glycerin and fatty acid chains), phospholipids (e.g., phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol), sphingolipids (e.g., sphingomyelin, cerebrosides and gangliosides), and sterols (e.g., cholesterol).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0095">Lipid affinity: A measurement of the relative binding affinity of an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix for lipids. Any number of methods well know to one of skill in the art can be used to determine lipid affinity. In one embodiment, the lipid affinity of an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix is determined by calculating the hydrophobic moment score of the amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix. For example, an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix with relatively high lipid affinity will have a hydrophobic moment score per residue greater than or equal to about 0.34 on the Eisenberg scale (100 degree alpha helix), while an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix with relatively low lipid affinity will have a hydrophobic moment score per residue of less than about 0.34 on the Eisenberg scale (Eisenberg et al., <i>Faraday Symp. Chem. Soc. </i>17:109-120, 1982). In an alternative embodiment, an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix with relatively high lipid affinity has a hydrophobic moment score per residue of about 0.40 to about 0.60 on the Eisenberg consensus scale, while a low lipid affinity helix will have a hydrophobic moment score per residue of about 0.20 to about 0.40 on the consensus scale (Eisenberg et al., <i>PNAS </i>81:140-144, 1984 and Eisenberg et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>179:125-142, 1984). With any one peptide or peptide analog with multiple amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains, it is to be understood that the difference between the hydrophobic moment scores of the amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix with the relatively high lipid affinity and the amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix with the relatively low lipid affinity is at least 0.01 on the consensus scale. In some embodiments, the difference is higher than 0.01, such as 0.02, 0.05, 0.08 or 0.1.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0096">In other embodiments, the lipid affinity of an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix is determined by one or more functional tests. Specific, non-limiting examples of functional tests include: retention time on reverse phase HPLC, surface monolayer exclusion pressure (Palgunachari et al., <i>Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. </i>16:328-338, 1996), binding affinity to phospholipid vesicles (Palgunachari et al., <i>Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. </i>16:328-338, 1996), and DMPC vesicle solubilization (Remaley et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>44:828-836, 2003).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0097">Further non-limiting examples of alternative methods of calculating the lipid affinity of an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix include: total hydrophobic moment, total peptide hydrophobicity, total peptide hydrophobicity per residue, hydrophobicity of amino acids on the hydrophobic face, mean relative hydrophobic moment, hydrophobicity per residue of amino acids on the hydrophobic face, and calculated lipid affinity based on predicted peptide penetration into phospholipid bilayers (Palgunachari et al., <i>Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. </i>16:328-338, 1996). Different types of hydrophobicity scales for amino acids also can be used for calculating hydrophobic moments of amphipathic helices, which can result in a different relative ranking of their lipid affinity (Kyte et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>157:105-132, 1982).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0098">Lipoprotein lipase (LPL): An enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins, such as those present in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), into three free fatty acids and one glycerol molecule. A deficiency in lipoprotein lipase activity can lead to hypertriglyceridemia. In an example, LPL is activated (e.g., stimulated or turned-on) by an apoC-II protein, such as a fragment of an apoC-II protein including the third helix of apoC-II. For example, LPL is activated by a polypeptide that includes a domain with an amino acid sequence set forth in any of SEQ ID NOs: 63-69. LPL activation can be measured by methods known of those to skill in the art including those described in detail in Example 10. In an example, LPL activation can be determined in vivo by obtaining a sample from a subject and measuring triglyceride levels in such sample prior to and after treatment with one or more of the disclosed peptides. A peptide that increases triglyceride levels above the baseline value by more than 3 times (x's; e.g., 3&#xd7;) the coefficient of variation of the assay, which for most triglycerides assays would be approximately 2-5%, is considered a peptide that inhibits LPL. Any peptide that lowers the serum triglyceride compared to the result obtained with the in vivo administration of the 5A peptide by more than 3&#xd7; the coefficient of variation of triglyceride assay is considered a peptide that activates LPL. A potentially clinically useful LPL-activating peptide is a peptide that, when administered to subjects, results in a triglyceride level of less than 150 mg/dl, such as less than 145 mg/dl, 140 mg/dl, 135 mg/dl, 130 mg/dl, 125 mg/dl or 120 mg/dl.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0099">Non-cytotoxic: A non-cytotoxic compound is one that does not substantially affect the viability or growth characteristics of a cell at a dosage normally used to treat the cell or a subject. Furthermore, the percentage of cells releasing intracellular contents, such as LDH or hemoglobin, is low (e.g., about 10% or less) in cells treated with a non-cytotoxic compound. Lipid efflux from a cell that occurs by a non-cytotoxic compound results in the removal of lipid from a cell by a process that maintains the overall integrity of the cell membrane and does not lead to significant cell toxicity.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0100">Non-polar: A non-polar compound is one that does not have concentrations of positive or negative electric charge. Non-polar compounds, such as, for example, oil, are not well soluble in water.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0101">Peptide: A polymer in which the monomers are amino acid residues which are joined together through amide bonds. When the amino acids are alpha-amino acids, either the L-optical isomer or the D-optical isomer can be used. The terms &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; or &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; as used herein are intended to encompass any amino acid sequence and include modified sequences such as glycoproteins. The term &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; is specifically intended to cover naturally occurring peptides, as well as those which are recombinantly or synthetically produced. The term &#x201c;residue&#x201d; or &#x201c;amino acid residue&#x201d; includes reference to an amino acid that is incorporated into a peptide, polypeptide, or protein.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0102">Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers: The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (vehicles) useful in this disclosure are conventional. <i>Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences</i>, by E. W. Martin, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 15th Edition (1975), describes compositions and formulations suitable for pharmaceutical delivery of one or more therapeutic compounds or molecules, such as one or more multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs and additional pharmaceutical agents.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0103">In general, the nature of the carrier will depend on the particular mode of administration being employed. For instance, parenteral formulations usually comprise injectable fluids that include pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluids such as water, physiological saline, balanced salt solutions, aqueous dextrose, glycerol or the like as a vehicle. For solid compositions (e.g., powder, pill, tablet, or capsule forms), conventional non-toxic solid carriers can include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, or magnesium stearate. In addition to biologically-neutral carriers, pharmaceutical compositions to be administered can contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives, and pH buffering agents and the like, for example sodium acetate or sorbitan monolaurate.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0104">Phospholipid: A phospholipid consists of a water-soluble polar head, linked to two water-insoluble non-polar tails (by a negatively charged phosphate group). Both tails consist of a fatty acid, each about 14 to about 24 carbon groups long. When placed in an aqueous environment, phospholipids form a bilayer or micelle, where the hydrophobic tails line up against each other. This forms a membrane with hydrophilic heads on both sides. A phospholipid is a lipid that is a primary component of animal cell membranes.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0105">Polar: A polar molecule is one in which the centers of positive and negative charge distribution do not converge. Polar molecules are characterized by a dipole moment, which measures their polarity, and are soluble in other polar compounds and virtually insoluble in nonpolar compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0106">Recombinant nucleic acid: A sequence that is not naturally occurring or has a sequence that is made by an artificial combination of two otherwise separated segments of sequence. This artificial combination is often accomplished by chemical synthesis or, more commonly, by the artificial manipulation of isolated segments of nucleic acids, for example, by genetic engineering techniques such as those described in Sambrook et al. (ed.), <i>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, </i>2<sup>nd </sup>ed., vol. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989. The term recombinant includes nucleic acids that have been altered solely by addition, substitution, or deletion of a portion of the nucleic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0107">Therapeutically effective amount: A quantity of a specified agent (or combination of agents) sufficient to achieve a desired effect in a subject being treated with that agent. For example, this can be the amount of a multi-domain peptide or peptide analog useful in preventing, ameliorating, and/or treating a dyslipidemic disorder (e.g., atherosclerosis) in a subject. Ideally, a therapeutically effective amount of an agent is an amount sufficient to prevent, ameliorate, and/or treat a dyslipidemic disorder (e.g., atherosclerosis) in a subject without causing a substantial cytotoxic effect (e.g., membrane microsolubilization) in the subject. The effective amount of an agent useful for preventing, ameliorating, and/or treating a dyslipidemic disorder (e.g., atherosclerosis) in a subject will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder, and the manner of administration of the therapeutic composition. In an example, a therapeutically effective amount of one of the disclosed peptides (or peptide mixtures, such as a peptide including a first domain capable of promoting lipid efflux and a second domain having lipoprotein lipase activity) results in a triglyceride level of at least less than 150 mg/dl, such as less than 145 mg/dl, less than 140 mg/dl, less than 135 mg/dl, less than 130 mg/dl, less than 125 mg/dl or less than 120 mg/dl.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0108">Transformed: A &#x201c;transformed&#x201d; cell is a cell into which has been introduced a nucleic acid molecule by molecular biology techniques. The term encompasses all techniques by which a nucleic acid molecule might be introduced into such a cell, including transfection with viral vectors, transformation with plasmid vectors, and introduction of naked DNA by electroporation, lipofection, and particle gun acceleration.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">III. Overview of Several Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0099" num="0109">Isolated peptides and peptide analogs with multiple amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains that promote lipid efflux from cells via an ABCA1-dependent pathway are disclosed herein. In one embodiment, the multi-domain peptides include multiple amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains, wherein a first amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain exhibits higher lipid affinity compared to a second amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain (as measured, e.g., by their hydrophobic moments; see Eisenberg et al., <i>Faraday Symp. Chem. Soc. </i>17:109-120, 1982; Eisenberg et al., <i>PNAS </i>81:140-144, 1984; and Eisenberg et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>179:125-142, 1984), and wherein the peptide or peptide analog promotes lipid efflux from cells by an ABCA1-dependent pathway.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0110">In specific, non-limiting examples, the first amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain has a hydrophobic moment score (Eisenberg scale; 100 degree-alpha helix) per residue of about 0.3 to about 0.60 and the second amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain has a hydrophobic moment score per residue of about 0.1 to about 0.33, wherein the difference between the hydrophobic moment scores of the first amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix and the second amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix is at least 0.01. In some embodiments, the difference is higher than 0.01, such as 0.02, 0.05, 0.08 or 0.1. For example, the 5A peptide (SEQ ID NO: 3) has a hydrophobic moment score (Eisenberg scale; 100 degree-alpha helix) per reside of 0.34 for the N-terminal lipid affinity helix and a hydrophobic moment score per residue of 0.28 for the C-terminal low lipid affinity helix. Using an alternative scale calculation, the 5A peptide (SEQ ID NO: 3) has a hydrophobic moment score 0.4905 for the N-terminal high lipid affinity helix and a hydrophobic moment score per residue of 0.3825 for the C-terminal low lipid affinity helix. Optionally, the order of relatively high and relatively low amphipathic helices can be reversed in the peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0111">Using a relative mean hydrophobic moment score, which is normalized to a &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; amphipathic helix with a maximum score of 0.83, the two helices of the 5A peptide (SEQ ID NO: 3) have values of 0.42 and 0.34. It is well recognized that different physical properties, however, can be used for determining the hydrophobicity of amino acids, which results in different scales for calculating the hydrophobic moment of peptides. Calculations with these different scales can change the absolute value of the hydrophobicity scores and the relative ranking of the lipid affinity of amphipathic helices. For example, using the Kyte &#x26; Doolittle scale (Kyte et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>157:105-132, 1982), the N-terminal and C-terminal helices of the 5A peptide would be seen to have hydrophobic moment scores of 1.47 and 1.26, with a relative mean hydrophobic moment scores of 0.51 and 0.44 (perfect helix: 2.8). Using a combined consensus scale, which is a hybrid of several different scoring systems, the N-terminal and C-terminal helices of the 5A peptide would have hydrophobic moment scores of 4.01 and 2.02, with a relative mean hydrophobic moment score of 0.64 an 0.32 (perfect helix: 6.3). All such scales, calculations, and measurements can be used, converted and interchanged, as recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0112">Other representative non-limiting example peptides with multiple amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 4-45.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0113">Optionally, the isolated peptides and peptide analogs that promote ABCA1-dependent lipid efflux from cells are also substantially non-cytotoxic, for instance, do not significantly increase triglycerides (e.g., triglyceride levels less than 150 mg/dl or do not show a statically significant increase above baseline triglycerides values. Disclosed herein are also isolated peptides and peptide analogs (or combinations of peptides or analogs, which are not necessarily covalently linked one to another) capable of promoting lipid efflux from cells by an ABCA1-dependent pathway and activating lipoprotein lipase. In one embodiment, the isolated peptides and peptide analogs (or mixtures) include a first domain that promotes lipid efflux and a second domain that activates lipoprotein lipase; optionally, these domains are covalently linked, with or without the presence of a linking peptide or other bridging molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0114">In specific non-limiting examples, the first domain is an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain with a hydrophobic moment score (Eisenberg scale; 100 degree-alpha helix) per residue of about 0.34 to about 0.60 and the second domain is an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain of apoC-II protein or a variant or fragment thereof that retains a lipoprotein lipase-activating property, such as a domain comprising an amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 63-69. Representative non-limiting example peptides with both lipid efflux promoting activity and lipoprotein lipase activating activity are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 70-75. In one example, a peptide has the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 70. LPL activation can be measured by methods known of those to skill in the art including those described in detail in Example 10. In an example, LPL activation can be determined in vivo by obtaining a sample from a subject and measuring triglyceride levels in such sample prior to and after treatment with one or more of the disclosed peptides. A triglyceride level of less than 150 mg/dl following treatment of a subject (such as a human subject) with a test compound indicates that the compound (e.g., apoC-II protein, fragment or variant thereof) is a LPL activator.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0115">The isolated peptides and peptide analogs disclosed herein can also include an additional functional domain or peptide. Specific, non-limiting examples of the additional functional domains or peptides include a heparin binding site, an integrin binding site, a P-selectin site, a TAT HIV sequence, a panning sequence, a penatratin sequence, a SAA C-terminus sequence, a SAA N-terminus sequence, a LDL receptor sequence, a modified 18A sequence, an apoA-I Milano sequence, a 6&#xd7;-His sequence, a lactoferrin sequence, a lipoprotein lipase activating domain (such as a fragment or variant of apoC-II) or combinations of two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0116">Pharmaceutical compositions are disclosed that include one or more isolated peptides or peptide analogs with multiple amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains that promote lipid efflux from cells via an ABCA1-dependent pathway. Representative peptides with multiple amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 3-45. Pharmaceutical compositions are also disclosed that include one or more isolated peptides or peptide analogs that promote lipid efflux from cells via an ABCA1-dependent pathway and activate lipoprotein lipase, such as representative peptides shown in SEQ ID NOs: 70-75. In one specific example, the pharmaceutical composition includes a peptide with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 70.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0117">Methods are provided for treating or inhibiting dyslipidemic and vascular disorders in a subject. In one embodiment, this method includes administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition that includes one or more isolated peptides or peptide analogs with two or more amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains that promote lipid efflux from cells via an ABCA1-dependent pathway and activate lipoprotein lipase. In specific, non-limiting examples, the dyslipidemic and vascular disorders include hyperlipidemia, hyperlipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, HDL deficiency, apoA-I deficiency, coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, thrombotic stroke, peripheral vascular disease, restenosis, acute coronary syndrome, and reperfusion myocardial injury.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0118">In certain examples of the provided method, the isolated peptide includes two amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains in which the first domain has lipid efflux promoting activity and the second domain has lipoprotein lipase activity (such as an apoC-II protein, fragment or variant with an amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 63-69). In one example, the isolated peptide includes the amino sequence of SEQ ID NO: 70. In other examples of the provided method, the isolated peptide includes two or more amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain capable of promoting lipid efflux with an apoC-II variant or fragment (such as provided in SEQ ID NO: 69) attached to the C-terminal end of at least one of the lipid efflux promoting amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0119">In other non-limiting examples of the provided method, the method includes administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition that includes at least one isolated peptide (or peptide analog) with multiple amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains and that promotes lipid efflux from cells via an ABCA1-dependent pathway (such as an isolated peptide that includes two amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains and has an amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 3-45) and a separate lipoprotein lipase activating agent, such as an apoC-II protein, variant or fragment thereof (e.g., peptide) that retains lipoprotein lipase activity (e.g., results in triglyceride levels of less than 150 mg/dl). The peptide that promotes efflux need not be covalently linked to the peptide that has LPL activating activity.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0120">Methods for identifying non-cytotoxic peptides that promote ABCA1-dependent lipid efflux from cells and/or peptides that activate lipoprotein lipase in cells (or peptides that have both activities) are also disclosed.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">IV. Multi-Domain Amphipathic Peptides</heading>
<p id="p-0111" num="0121">Isolated peptides and peptide analogs including peptides with multiple amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains that promote lipid efflux from cells via an ABCA1-dependent pathway have been identified and are described in, for instance, PCT Publication No. WO 2006/044596 (PCT/US2005/036933), as well as the corresponding U.S. National Stage application (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/577,259), which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Various peptides described therein included a first amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain exhibited higher lipid affinity relative to a second amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain, in the same peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0122">ApoA-I, the predominant protein constituent of HDL (Panagotopulos et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>277:39477-39484, 2002), is believed to promote lipid efflux from cells by a detergent-like extraction process (Remaley et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>44:828-836, 2003). The ABCA1 transporter has been proposed to facilitate this process by creating a lipid microdomain that promotes the binding of apoA-I to cells and creates a lipid domain that is susceptible for removal by apoA-I by a detergent-like extraction process. ApoA-I, like most of the other natural exchangeable type apolipoproteins, is almost completely dependent upon the presence of ABCA1 for promoting lipid efflux (Remaley et al., <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </i>280:818-823, 2001). Furthermore, when lipid efflux occurs by apoA-I and the other natural exchangeable type apolipoproteins, it occurs by a non-cytotoxic process, whereby the integrity of the cell membrane is maintained (Remaley et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>44:828-836, 2003). ApoA-I contains at least 8 large amphipathic helical domains, which have a wide range of lipid affinity (Gillote et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>274:2021-2028, 1999).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0123">Synthetic peptides of each helix of apoA-I have been made, and it has been shown that only 2 of the 8 large amphipathic helices of apoA-I, which have relatively high lipid affinity, can by themselves promote lipid efflux from cells in culture (Gillote et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>274:2021-2028, 1999 and Palgunachari et al., <i>Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. </i>16:328-338, 1996). Additionally, synthetic peptide mimics of apolipoproteins have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties (Van Lenten et al., <i>Trends Cardiovasc. Med. </i>11:155-161, 2001; Navab et al., <i>Cur. Opin. Lipidol. </i>9:449-456, 1998; Barter et al., <i>Cur. Opin. Lipidol. </i>13:285-288, 2002).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0124">Previously, synthetic peptide mimics of apolipoproteins have been designed to have high lipid affinity (Remaley et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>44:828-836, 2003; Segrest et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>33:141-166, 1992; Anantharamaiah et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>260:10248-10255, 1985; Garber et al, <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>42:545-552, 2001; Navab et al., <i>Circulation </i>105:290-292, 2002; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,156,727), because high lipid affinity has been shown to be a necessary feature for a peptide to mediate lipid efflux by the ABCA1 transporter (Remaley et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>44:828-836, 2003). It has also been shown, however, that peptide mimics of apoA-I with high lipid affinity can also promote lipid efflux independent of the ABCA1 transporter (Remaley et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>44:828-836, 2003). Such peptides have been shown to promote lipid efflux from cells not expressing the ABCA1 transporter, and from Tangier disease cells that do not contain a functional ABCA1 transporter (Remaley et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>44:828-836, 2003). Furthermore, synthetic peptide mimics of apoA-I that posses high lipid affinity can also extract lipid by a passive physical process, based on their ability to remove lipid from cells that have been fixed with paraformaldehyde (Remaley et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>44:828-836, 2003). Lipid efflux from cells by this ABCA1-independent pathway has been shown to be cytotoxic to cells, based on the cellular release of LDH (Remaley et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>44:828-836, 2003).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0125">In addition to the undesirable cytotoxic effect on cells, ABCA1-independent lipid efflux may also reduce the therapeutic benefit of such peptides by reducing their in vivo capacity for removing lipid from cells affected by the atherosclerotic process. For example, even in subjects with dyslipidemic and vascular disorders, most cells do not have excess cellular cholesterol and, therefore, do not express the ABCA1 transporter. Cells, such as macrophages, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, which are present in atherosclerotic plaques, are all prone to lipid accumulation, and express ABCA1 when loaded with excess cholesterol. The expression of ABCA1 by these cells has been shown to be exquisitely regulated by the cholesterol content of cells (Langmann et al., <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </i>257:29-33, 1999). Induction of the ABCA1 transporter by intracellular cholesterol is a protective cellular mechanism against excess intracellular cholesterol and has been shown to be critical in preventing the development of atherosclerosis (Dean and Chimini, <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>42:1007-1017, 2001). Peptide mimics of apolipoproteins that are not specific for removing cholesterol by the ABCA1 transporter would be less therapeutically effective in removing cholesterol from ABCA1 expressing cells because any cholesterol removed by the peptides from the more abundant non-ABCA1 expressing cells will reduce the overall total cholesterol binding capacity of these peptides. The selective and non-cytotoxic removal of lipid from only cells that express the ABCA1 transporter would, therefore, be a desirable property for therapeutic peptide mimics of apolipoproteins.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0126">The current disclosure provides isolated multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs that specifically efflux lipids from cells by the ABCA1 transporter in a non-cytotoxic manner. In one embodiment, such peptides or peptide analogs contain an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain that exhibits relatively high lipid affinity (e.g., a hydrophobic moment score (Eisenberg scale; 100 degree-alpha helix) per residue of about 0.3 to about 0.60) and a second amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain with relatively low lipid affinity (e.g., a hydrophobic moment score per residue of about 0.1 to about 0.33), wherein the difference between the hydrophobic moment scores of the amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix with the relatively high lipid affinity and the amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix with the relatively low lipid affinity is at least 0.01. In some embodiments, the difference is higher than 0.01, such as 0.02, 0.05, 0.08 or 0.10.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0127">Peptides containing one amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix with a relatively high lipid affinity, when coupled to another &#x3b1;-helix with a relatively low lipid affinity, are specific for removing lipids from cells by the ABCA1 transporter. In particular examples, these peptides are not only specific for removing lipids from cells by the ABCA1 transporter, but are also capable of activating lipoprotein lipase.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0128">The degree of amphipathicity (i.e., degree of asymmetry of hydrophobicity) in the multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs can be conveniently quantified by calculating the hydrophobic moment (&#x3bc;<sub>H</sub>) of each of the amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains. Methods for calculating &#x3bc;<sub>H </sub>for a particular peptide sequence are well-known in the art, and are described, for example in Eisenberg et al., <i>Faraday Symp. Chem. Soc. </i>17:109-120, 1982; Eisenberg et al., <i>PNAS </i>81:140-144, 1984; and Eisenberg et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>179:125-142, 1984. The actual &#x3bc;<sub>H </sub>obtained for a particular peptide sequence will depend on the total number of amino acid residues composing the peptide. The amphipathicities of peptides of different lengths can be directly compared by way of the mean hydrophobic moment. The mean hydrophobic moment per residue can be obtained by dividing &#x3bc;<sub>H </sub>by the number of residues in the peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0129">In another embodiment, such peptides or peptide analogs contain an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain that exhibits relatively high lipid affinity (e.g., a hydrophobic moment score (Eisenberg scale; 100 degree-alpha helix) per residue of about 0.30 to about 0.60) and a second amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain with moderate lipid affinity (e.g., a hydrophobic moment score (Eisenberg scale; 100 degree-alpha helix) per residue of about 0.29 to about 0.33), wherein the difference between the hydrophobic moment scores of the amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix with the relatively high lipid affinity and the amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix with the relatively moderate lipid affinity is at least 0.01. In some embodiments, the difference is higher than 0.01, such as 0.02, 0.05, 0.08 or 0.1. Such peptides have reduced specificity for the ABCA1 transporter, as compared to peptides containing one amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix with a relatively high lipid affinity and one amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix with a relatively low lipid affinity, but are still less cytotoxic to cells than peptides that contain two amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains with relatively high lipid affinity.</p>

<p id="p-0126" num="0136">In the multi-domain peptides disclosed herein, the linkage between amino acid residues can be a peptide bond or amide linkage (i.e., &#x2014;C&#x2014;C(O)NH&#x2014;). Alternatively, one or more amide linkages are optionally replaced with a linkage other than amide, for example, a substituted amide. Substituted amides generally include, but are not limited to, groups of the formula &#x2014;C(O)NR&#x2014;, where R is (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>)alkyl, substituted (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>)alkyl, (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>)alkenyl, substituted (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>)alkenyl, (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>)alkynyl, substituted (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>)alkynyl, (C<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>20</sub>) aryl, substituted (C<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>20</sub>) aryl, (C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>26</sub>)alkaryl, substituted (C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>26</sub>)alkaryl, 5-20 membered heteroaryl, substituted 5-20 membered heteroaryl, 6-26 membered alkheteroaryl, and substituted 6-26 membered alkheteroaryl. Additionally, one or more amide linkages can be replaced with peptidomimetic or amide mimetic moieties which do not significantly interfere with the structure or activity of the peptides. Suitable amide mimetic moieties are described, for example, in Olson et al., <i>J. Med. Chem. </i>36:3039-3049, 1993.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0137">Additionally, in representative multi-domain peptides disclosed herein, the amino- and carboxy-terminal ends can be modified by conjugation with various functional groups. Neutralization of the terminal charge of synthetic peptide mimics of apolipoproteins has been shown to increase their lipid affinity (Yancey et al., <i>Biochem. </i>34:7955-7965, 1995; Venkatachalapathi et al., <i>Protein: Structure, Function and Genetics </i>15:349-359, 1993). For example, acetylation of the amino terminal end of amphipathic peptides increases the lipid affinity of the peptide (Mishra et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>269:7185-7191, 1994). Other possible end modifications are described, for example, in Brouillette et al., <i>Biochem. Biophys. Acta </i>1256:103-129, 1995: Mishra et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>269:7185-7191, 1994; and Mishra et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>270:1602-1611, 1995.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0138">Furthermore, in representative multi-domain peptides disclosed herein, the amino acid proline is used to link the multiple amphipathic &#x3b1;-helices. However, other suitable amino acids (such as glycine, serine, threonine, and alanine) that functionally separate the multiple amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains can be used. In some embodiments, the linking amino acid will have the ability to impart a &#x3b2;-turn at the linkage, such as glycine, serine, threonine, and alanine. In addition, larger linkers containing two or more amino acids or bifunctional organic compounds, such as H<sub>2</sub>N(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>COOH, where n is an integer from 1 to 12, can also be used. Examples of such linkers, as well as methods of making such linkers and peptides incorporating such linkers, are well-known in the art (see, e.g., Hunig et al., <i>Chem. Ber. </i>100:3039-3044, 1974 and Basak et al., <i>Bioconjug. Chem. </i>5:301-305, 1994).</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0139">Also encompassed by the present disclosure are modified forms of the multi-domain peptides, wherein one or more amino acids in the peptides are substituted with another amino acid residue. The simplest modifications involve the substitution of one or more amino acids for amino acids having similar physiochemical and/or structural properties. These so-called conservative substitutions are likely to have minimal impact on the activity and/or structure of the resultant peptide. Examples of conservative substitutions are shown below.</p>

<p id="p-0131" num="0141">Conservative substitutions generally maintain (a) the structure of the peptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0142">Amino acids are typically classified in one or more categories, including polar, hydrophobic, acidic, basic and aromatic, according to their side chains. Examples of polar amino acids include those having side chain functional groups such as hydroxyl, sulfhydryl, and amide, as well as the acidic and basic amino acids. Polar amino acids include, without limitation, asparagine, cysteine, glutamine, histidine, selenocysteine, serine, threonine, tryptophan and tyrosine. Examples of hydrophobic or non-polar amino acids include those residues having non-polar aliphatic side chains, such as, without limitation, leucine, isoleucine, valine, glycine, alanine, proline, methionine and phenylalanine. Examples of basic amino acid residues include those having a basic side chain, such as an amino or guanidino group. Basic amino acid residues include, without limitation, arginine, homolysine and lysine. Examples of acidic amino acid residues include those having an acidic side chain functional group, such as a carboxy group. Acidic amino acid residues include, without limitation aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Aromatic amino acids include those having an aromatic side chain group. Examples of aromatic amino acids include, without limitation, biphenylalanine, histidine, 2-napthylalananine, pentafluorophenylalanine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine. It is noted that some amino acids are classified in more than one group, for example, histidine, tryptophan and tyrosine are classified as both polar and aromatic amino acids. Additional amino acids that are classified in each of the above groups are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0143">The substitutions which in general are expected to produce the greatest changes in peptide properties will be non-conservative, for instance changes in which (a) a hydrophilic residue, for example, seryl or threonyl, is substituted for (or by) a hydrophobic residue, for example, leucyl, isoleucyl, phenylalanyl, valyl or alanyl; (b) a cysteine or proline is substituted for (or by) any other residue; (c) a residue having an electropositive side chain, for example, lysyl, arginyl, or histadyl, is substituted for (or by) an electronegative residue, for example, glutamyl or aspartyl; or (d) a residue having a bulky side chain, for example, phenylalanine, is substituted for (or by) one not having a side chain, for example, glycine.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0144">As the lipid affinity of an amphipathic helix is largely due to the hydrophobicity of the amino acid residues on the hydrophobic face of the helix (Eisenberg et al., <i>PNAS </i>81:140-144, 1984 and Eisenberg et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>179:125-142, 1984), the overall lipid affinity of an amphipathic helix can be reduced by replacing hydrophobic amino acids with more polar amino acids. In one embodiment, hydrophobic amino acids on the hydrophobic face of the 37-pA peptide (e.g., Phe, Leu or Val) were replaced with Ala, which is less hydrophobic than Phe, Leu and Val (Eisenberg et al., <i>PNAS </i>81:140-144, 1984 and Eisenberg et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>179:125-142, 1984). Specific, non-limiting examples include the 5A-37pA peptide (SEQ ID NO: 3), the 1A-37pA peptide (SEQ ID NO: 4), the 2A-37pA peptide (SEQ ID NO: 5), the 3A-37pA peptide (SEQ ID NO: 6), and the 4A-37pA peptide (SEQ ID NO: 7).</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0145">In another embodiment, hydrophobic amino acids on the hydrophobic face of the 37-pA peptide (e.g., Phe, Leu or Val) can be replaced with Gly, which is less hydrophobic than Phe, Leu and Val (Eisenberg et al., <i>PNAS </i>81:140-144, 1984 and Eisenberg et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>179:125-142, 1984). Specific, non-limiting examples include those peptides shown in SEQ ID NOs: 8-10. Other slightly hydrophobic amino acids can be used in place of Ala or Gly for the substitutions (Eisenberg et al., <i>PNAS </i>81:140-144, 1984 and Eisenberg et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>179:125-142, 1984).</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0146">In addition to the naturally occurring genetically encoded amino acids, amino acid residues in the multi-domain peptides may be substituted with naturally occurring non-encoded amino acids and synthetic amino acids. Certain commonly encountered amino acids which provide useful substitutions include, but are not limited to, &#x3b2;-alanine and other omega-amino acids, such as 3-aminopropionic acid, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, 4-aminobutyric acid and the like; &#x3b1;-aminoisobutyric acid; &#x3b5;-aminohexanoic acid; &#x3b4;-aminovaleric acid; N-methylglycine or sarcosine; ornithine; citrulline; t-butylalanine; t-butylglycine; N-methylisoleucine; phenylglycine; cyclohexylalanine; norleucine; naphthylalanine; 4-chlorophenylalanine; 2-fluorophenylalanine; 3-fluorophenylalanine; 4-fluorophenylalanine; penicillamine; 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid; &#x3b2;-2-thienylalanine; methionine sulfoxide; homoarginine; N-acetyl lysine; 2,4-diaminobutyric acid; 2,3-diaminobutyric acid; p-aminophenylalanine; N-methyl valine; homocysteine; homophenylalanine; homoserine; hydroxyproline; homoproline; N-methylated amino acids; and peptoids (N-substituted glycines).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0147">While in certain embodiments, the amino acids of the multi-domain peptides will be substituted with L-amino acids, the substitutions are not limited to L-amino acids. Thus, also encompassed by the present disclosure are modified forms of the multi-domain peptides, wherein an L-amino acid is replaced with an identical D-amino acid (e.g., L-Arg&#x2192;D-Arg) or with a conservatively-substituted D-amino acid (e.g., L-Arg&#x2192;D-Lys), and vice versa. Specific, non-limiting examples include those peptides shown in SEQ ID NOs: 27-30 (see Table 2; substituted amino acids are underlined).</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0148">In addition to making amino acid substitutions, other methods can be used to reduce the lipid affinity of an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain. Examples of such methods include shortening the helical domain (specific, non-limiting examples include those peptides shown in SEQ ID NOs: 11-14), adding or deleting one or more amino acids to change the helix's phase (specific, non-limiting examples include those peptides shown in SEQ ID NOs: 19-22 and 15-18, respectively), and changing the Type A amphipathic helical charge distribution of the polar face by switching the location of the positive and negative charge residues (specific, non-limiting examples include those peptides shown in SEQ ID NOs: 23-26; Segrest et al., <i>Adv. Protein Chem. </i>45:303-369, 1994). Additional methods include, for example, combining natural high lipid affinity helices with artificially designed low lipid affinity helices (specific, non-limiting examples include those peptides shown in SEQ ID NOs: 31-34), combining natural low lipid affinity helices with artificially designed high lipid affinity helices (specific, non-limiting examples include those peptides shown in SEQ ID NOs: 35-38), and combining non-contiguous natural low lipid affinity helices with natural high lipid affinity helices (specific, non-limiting examples include those peptides shown in SEQ ID NOs: 39-42). Replacing Lys residues at the interface between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic face with Arg (which decreases the ability of amphipathic peptides to insert in phospholipid bilayers, Palgunachari et al., <i>Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. </i>16:328-338, 1996), is an additional method of reducing the lipid affinity of an amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domain (specific, non-limiting examples include those peptides shown in SEQ ID NOs: 43-45).</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0149">Many of these changes to the amphipathic helix will be reflected in a decrease in the hydrophobic moment of the peptide. However, some modifications (e.g., D-amino acid substitutions, changes to the charge distribution of the polar face residues and replacing Lys residues with Arg residues) of the amphipathic helix may not alter the calculated hydrophobic moment, but will reduce the lipid affinity of the peptide. In such instances, a functional test of lipid affinity, such as retention time on reverse phase HPLC can be used to assess the impact of any change on the lipid affinity of the peptide (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Additional, non-limiting examples of functional tests that can be used to measure the lipid affinity of the multi-domain peptides disclosed herein include: surface monolayer exclusion pressure (Palgunachari et al., <i>Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. </i>16:328-338, 1996), binding affinity to phospholipid vesicles (Palgunachari et al., <i>Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. </i>16:328-338, 1996) and DMPC vesicle solubilization (Remaley et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>44:828-836, 2003). Further examples of alternative methods of calculating the predicted lipid affinity of the multi-domain peptides include: total hydrophobic moment, total peptide hydrophobicity, total peptide hydrophobicity per residue, hydrophobicity of amino acids on the hydrophobic face, hydrophobicity per residue of amino acids on the hydrophobic face, and calculated lipid affinity based on predicted peptide penetration into phospholipid bilayers (Palgunachari et al., <i>Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. </i>16:328-338, 1996). Regardless of the parameter(s) used to assess the lipid affinity of the multi-domain peptides, those peptides that contain at least two or more helices, with at least one helix having relatively high lipid affinity and one helix having relatively low lipid affinity, are considered to be encompassed by the present disclosure. If alternative tests or alternative calculations are used instead of the hydrophobic moment calculation for calculating lipid affinity, the optimal value of lipid affinity for the high and low lipid affinity helices can be functionally determined by performing cytotoxicity assays (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) and lipid efflux assays on non-ABCA1 expressing and ABCA1 expressing cells (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0150">Also encompassed by the present disclosure are multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs, wherein the multiple amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains are comprised of dimers, trimers, tetramers and even higher order polymers (i.e., &#x201c;multimers&#x201d;) comprising the same or different sequences. Such multimers may be in the form of tandem repeats. The amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains may be directly attached to one another or separated by one or more linkers. The amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains can be connected in a head-to-tail fashion (i.e., N-terminus to C-terminus), a head-to-head fashion, (i.e., N-terminus to N-terminus), a tail-to-tail fashion (i.e., C-terminus to C-terminus), and/or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the multimers are tandem repeats of two, three, four, and up to about ten amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains, but any number of amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains that has the desired effect of specifically promoting ABCA1 lipid efflux with low cytotoxicity can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0151">Additional aspects of the disclosure include analogs, variants, derivatives, and mimetics based on the amino acid sequence of the multi-domain peptides disclosed herein. Typically, mimetic compounds are synthetic compounds having a three-dimensional structure (of at least part of the mimetic compound) that mimics, for example, the primary, secondary, and/or tertiary structural, and/or electrochemical characteristics of a selected peptide, structural domain, active site, or binding region (e.g., a homotypic or heterotypic binding site, a catalytic active site or domain, a receptor or ligand binding interface or domain, or a structural motif) thereof. The mimetic compound will often share a desired biological activity with a native peptide, as discussed herein (e.g., the ability to interact with lipids). Typically, at least one subject biological activity of the mimetic compound is not substantially reduced in comparison to, and is often the same as or greater than, the activity of the native peptide on which the mimetic was modeled.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0152">A variety of techniques well known to one of skill in the art are available for constructing peptide mimetics with the same, similar, increased, or reduced biological activity as the corresponding native peptide. Often these analogs, variants, derivatives and mimetics will exhibit one or more desired activities that are distinct or improved from the corresponding native peptide, for example, improved characteristics of solubility, stability, lipid interaction, susceptibility to hydrolysis or proteolysis (see, e.g., Morgan and Gainor, <i>Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. </i>24:243-252, 1989) and/or lipoprotein lipase activity. For example, a peptide mimetic with lipoprotein lipase activity may be generated by incorporating apoC-II amino acid residues known to be involved in apoC-II lipoprotein lipase activation (such as one or more of the amino acids provided in SEQ ID NO:69) into one of the disclosed multi-domain peptides. In one particular example, a peptide mimetic with lipid efflux activity and lipoprotein lipase activating activity is a peptide with an amino acid sequence provided by SEQ ID NOs: 70-75, such as SEQ ID NO: 70.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0153">In addition, mimetic compounds of the disclosure can have other desired characteristics that enhance their therapeutic application, such as increased cell permeability, greater affinity and/or avidity for a binding partner, and/or prolonged biological half-life. The mimetic compounds of the disclosure can have a backbone that is partially or completely non-peptide, but with side groups identical to the side groups of the amino acid residues that occur in the peptide on which the mimetic compound is modeled. Several types of chemical bonds, for example, ester, thioester, thioamide, retroamide, reduced carbonyl, dimethylene and ketomethylene bonds, are known in the art to be generally useful substitutes for peptide bonds in the construction of protease-resistant mimetic compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0154">In one embodiment, multi-domain peptides useful within the disclosure are modified to produce peptide mimetics by replacement of one or more naturally occurring side chains of the 20 genetically encoded amino acids (or D-amino acids) with other side chains, for example with groups such as alkyl, lower alkyl, cyclic 4-, 5-, 6-, to 7-membered alkyl, amide, amide lower alkyl, amide di(lower alkyl), lower alkoxy, hydroxy, carboxy and the lower ester derivatives thereof, and with 4-, 5-, 6-, 5 to 7-membered heterocyclics. For example, proline analogs can be made in which the ring size of the proline residue is changed from a 5-membered ring to a 4-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. Cyclic groups can be saturated or unsaturated, and if unsaturated, can be aromatic or non-aromatic. Heterocyclic groups can contain one or more nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulphur heteroatoms. Examples of such groups include furazanyl, furyl, imidazolidinyl, imidazolyl, imidazolinyl, isothiazolyl, isoxazolyl, morpholinyl (e.g., morpholino), oxazolyl, piperazinyl (e.g., 1-piperazinyl), piperidyl (e.g., 1-piperidyl, piperidino), pyranyl, pyrazinyl, pyrazolidinyl, pyrazolinyl, pyrazolyl, pyridazinyl, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrrolidinyl (e.g., 1-pyrrolidinyl), pyrrolinyl, pyrrolyl, thiadiazolyl, thiazolyl, thienyl, thiomorpholinyl (e.g., thiomorpholino), and triazolyl groups. These heterocyclic groups can be substituted or unsubstituted. Where a group is substituted, the substituent can be alkyl, alkoxy, halogen, oxygen, or substituted or unsubstituted phenyl. Peptides, as well as peptide analogs and mimetics, can also be covalently bound to one or more of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, for example, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkenes, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192; and 4,179,337.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0155">Other peptide analogs and mimetics within the scope of the disclosure include glycosylation variants, and covalent or aggregate conjugates with other chemical moieties. Covalent derivatives can be prepared by linkage of functionalities to groups which are found in amino acid side chains or at the N- or C-termini, by means which are well known in the art. These derivatives can include, without limitation, aliphatic esters or amides of the carboxyl terminus, or of residues containing carboxyl side chains, O-acyl derivatives of hydroxyl group-containing residues, and N-acyl derivatives of the amino terminal amino acid or amino-group containing residues (e.g., lysine or arginine). Acyl groups are selected from the group of alkyl-moieties including C3 to C18 normal alkyl, thereby forming alkanoyl aroyl species. Also embraced are versions of a native primary amino acid sequence which have other minor modifications, including phosphorylated amino acid residues, for example, phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, or phosphothreonine, or other moieties, including ribosyl groups or cross-linking reagents.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0156">In another embodiment, a detectable moiety can be linked to the multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs disclosed herein, creating a peptide/peptide analog-detectable moiety conjugate. Detectable moieties suitable for such use include any composition detectable by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, electrical, optical or chemical means. The detectable moieties contemplated for the present disclosure can include, but are not limited to, an immunofluorescent moiety (e.g., fluorescein, rhodamine, Texas red, and the like), a radioactive moiety (e.g., <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>35</sup>S), an enzyme moiety (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase), a colorimetric moiety (e.g., colloidal gold, biotin, colored glass or plastic, and the like). The detectable moiety can be liked to the multi-domain peptide or peptide analog at either the N- and/or C-terminus Optionally, a linker can be included between the multi-domain peptide or peptide analog and the detectable moiety.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0157">Means of detecting such moieties are well known to those of skill in the art. Thus, for example, radiolabels may be detected using photographic film or scintillation counters, fluorescent markers may be detected using a photodetector to detect emitted illumination. Enzymatic labels are typically detected by providing the enzyme with a substrate and detecting the reaction product produced by the action of the enzyme on the substrate, and colorimetric labels are detected by simply visualizing the colored label.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0158">In another embodiment, an additional functional domain or peptide can be linked to the multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs disclosed herein, creating a peptide/peptide analog-additional functional domain/peptide conjugate. The additional functional domain or peptide can be linked to the multi-domain peptide or peptide analog at either the N- and/or C-terminus. Optionally, a linker can be included between the multi-domain peptide or peptide analog and the additional functional domain or peptide. The additional functional domain or peptide can enhance the ability of the multi-domain peptide or peptide analog to efflux lipids from cells in a non-cytotoxic manner, and/or enhance its therapeutic efficacy. Exemplary additional functional domains/peptides include those shown in Table 5.</p>

<p id="p-0150" num="0160">Cell recognition sequences can increase the ability of the multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs containing these sequences to bind to cells, the prerequisite first step in ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux (Remaley et al., <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </i>280:818-823, 2001). Cell internalization sequences, can increase the cellular uptake of the multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs into intracellular compartments, where the initial lipidation of the peptides has been proposed to occur (Neufeld et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>279:15571-15578, 2004), thus facilitating lipid efflux. Sequences that activate neutral cholesterol hydrolase (Kisilevsky et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>44:2257-2269, 2003) can increase the amount of intracellular free cholesterol, the form of cholesterol that effluxes from cells. Similarly, the inhibition of ACAT blocks the esterification of cholesterol to cholesteryl ester, thus increasing the pool of free cholesterol for efflux by the multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs (Kisilevsky et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>44:2257-2269, 2003). Sequences that target the multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs to the liver can facilitate the last step of reverse cholesterol transport, the hepatic uptake and excretion of cholesterol into the bile (Collet et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>40:1185-1193, 1999). Part of the beneficial effect of apoA-I and synthetic peptide mimics is believed to be due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties (Van Lenten et al., <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>96:2758-2767, 1995). Sequences containing domains that sequester oxidized lipids (Datta et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>279:26509-26517, 2004), that act as antioxidants (Bielicki et al., <i>Biochem. </i>41:2089-2096, 2002), or that chelate heavy metals (Wakabayashi et al., <i>Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. </i>63:955-957, 1999), which promote lipid oxidation, can compliment the lipid efflux properties of the multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs by also preventing lipid oxidation. Lipoprotein lipase activation sequences can prevent, reduce or inhibit hypertriglyceridemia associated with administration of any of the disclosed multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs. In an example, lipoprotein lipase activation sequences result in triglyceride levels of no greater than 200 mg/dl.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0161">LPL activation can be determined by methods known to those of skill in the art. In a particular example, an assay mixture of 200 &#x3bc;l containing 2 mg of triacylglycerols from a lipid emulsion can be used. The medium can contain 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris-Cl, 20 &#x3bc;g of heparin, and 12 mg of bovine serum albumin (pH 8.5). To study the activation, peptides can be dissolved in 5 M urea, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.2). Known activators of LPL, such as apoC-II, can be used as a positive control. The protein concentration can be determined by a bicinchoninic acid protein assay. Five &#x3bc;l of the stock solution of apoCIl, or the same volume of dilutions in 5 M urea, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.2), can be added to the incubations. The reactions can be started by addition of LPL and stopped after incubation for 15 min at 25&#xb0; C. by addition of organic solvents for extraction of the labeled free fatty acids. The lipase activity can be expressed in units/mg of LPL, where 1 unit corresponds to release of 1 &#x3bc;mol of fatty acid per min. An at least 10% increase in LPL activity, which is more than 3&#xd7; the coefficient of variation of most LPL assay, in the presence of a test peptide as compared to LPL activity in the absence of the test peptide, identifies the peptide as an LPL activating peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0162">In particular embodiments, the ability of the test peptides to activate LPL in vivo, can be determined by administering one or more of the peptides. Triglycerides levels in a sample taken from a subject receiving the peptide alone can then be compared to those levels present in a sample taken prior to the subject receiving the peptide or compared to a reference sample containing a known amount of triglycerides. Triglyceride levels of less than 150 mg/dl following peptide administration indicate that the peptide is an LPL activator or a peptide that causes a statistically significant decrease in the baseline triglyceride level when tested in vivo. The linkers contemplated by the present disclosure can be any bifunctional molecule capable of covalently linking two peptides to one another. Thus, suitable linkers are bifunctional molecules in which the functional groups are capable of being covalently attached to the N- and/or C-terminus of a peptide. Functional groups suitable for attachment to the N- or C-terminus of peptides are well known in the art, as are suitable chemistries for effecting such covalent bond formation.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0163">The linker may be flexible, rigid or semi-rigid. Suitable linkers include, for example, amino acid residues such as Pro or Gly or peptide segments containing from about 2 to about 5, 10, 15, 20, or even more amino acids, bifunctional organic compounds such as H<sub>2</sub>N(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>COOH where n is an integer from 1 to 12, and the like. Examples of such linkers, as well as methods of making such linkers and peptides incorporating such linkers, are well-known in the art (see, e.g., Hunig et al., <i>Chem. Ber. </i>100:3039-3044, 1974 and Basak et al., <i>Bioconjug. Chem. </i>5:301-305, 1994).</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0164">Conjugation methods applicable to the present disclosure include, by way of non-limiting example, reductive amination, diazo coupling, thioether bond, disulfide bond, amidation and thiocarbamoyl chemistries. In one embodiment, the amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains are &#x201c;activated&#x201d; prior to conjugation. Activation provides the necessary chemical groups for the conjugation reaction to occur. In one specific, non-limiting example, the activation step includes derivatization with adipic acid dihydrazide. In another specific, non-limiting example, the activation step includes derivatization with the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of 3-(2-pyridyl dithio)-propionic acid. In yet another specific, non-limiting example, the activation step includes derivatization with succinimidyl 3-(bromoacetamido) propionate. Further, non-limiting examples of derivatizing agents include succinimidylformylbenzoate and succinimidyllevulinate.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">V. Synthesis and Purification of the Peptides</heading>
<p id="p-0155" num="0165">The single and multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs of the disclosure can be prepared using virtually any technique known to one of ordinary skill in the art for the preparation of peptides. For example, the peptides can be prepared using step-wise solution or solid phase peptide syntheses, or recombinant DNA techniques, or the equivalents thereof.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">A. Chemical Synthesis</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0166">Peptides of the disclosure having either the D- or L-configuration can be readily synthesized by automated solid phase procedures well known in the art. Suitable syntheses can be performed by utilizing &#x201c;T-boc&#x201d; or &#x201c;F-moc&#x201d; procedures. Techniques and procedures for solid phase synthesis are described in <i>Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach</i>, by E. Atherton and R. C. Sheppard, published by IRL, Oxford University Press, 1989. Alternatively, the multi-domain peptides may be prepared by way of segment condensation, as described, for example, in Liu et al., <i>Tetrahedron Lett. </i>37:933-936, 1996; Baca et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>117:1881-1887, 1995; Tam et al., <i>Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. </i>45:209-216, 1995; Schnolzer and Kent, <i>Science </i>256:221-225, 1992; Liu and Tam, <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>116:4149-4153, 1994; Liu and Tam, <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>91:6584-6588, 1994; and Yamashiro and Li, Int. <i>J. Peptide Protein Res. </i>31:322-334, 1988). This is particularly the case with glycine containing peptides. Other methods useful for synthesizing the multi-domain peptides of the disclosure are described in Nakagawa et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>107:7087-7092, 1985.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0167">Additional exemplary techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art of peptide and peptide analog synthesis are taught by Bodanszky, M. and Bodanszky, A., <i>The Practice of Peptide Synthesis</i>, Springer Verlag, New York, 1994; and by Jones, J., <i>Amino Acid and Peptide Synthesis, </i>2nd ed., Oxford University Press, 2002. The Bodanszky and Jones references detail the parameters and techniques for activating and coupling amino acids and amino acid derivatives. Moreover, the references teach how to select, use and remove various useful functional and protecting groups.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0168">Peptides of the disclosure having either the D- or L-configuration can also be readily purchased from commercial suppliers of synthetic peptides. Such suppliers include, for example, Advanced ChemTech (Louisville, Ky.), Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.), Anaspec (San Jose, Calif.), and Cell Essentials (Boston, Mass.).</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">B. Recombinant Synthesis</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0169">If the peptide is composed entirely of gene-encoded amino acids, or a portion of it is so composed, the multi-domain peptide or the relevant portion can also be synthesized using conventional recombinant genetic engineering techniques. For recombinant production, a polynucleotide sequence encoding the multi-domain peptide is inserted into an appropriate expression vehicle, that is, a vector which contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted coding sequence, or in the case of an RNA viral vector, the necessary elements for replication and translation. The expression vehicle is then transfected into a suitable target cell which will express the multi-domain peptide. Depending on the expression system used, the expressed peptide is then isolated by procedures well-established in the art. Methods for recombinant protein and peptide production are well known in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et al. (ed.), <i>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual</i>, 2<sup>nd </sup>ed., vol. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989, Ch. 17 and Ausubel et al. <i>Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, </i>4<sup>th </sup>ed., John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc., 1999).</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0170">To increase efficiency of production, the polynucleotide can be designed to encode multiple units of the multi-domain peptide separated by enzymatic cleavage sites. The resulting polypeptide can be cleaved (e.g., by treatment with the appropriate enzyme) in order to recover the peptide units. This can increase the yield of peptides driven by a single promoter. In one embodiment, a polycistronic polynucleotide can be designed so that a single mRNA is transcribed which encodes multiple peptides, each coding region operatively linked to a cap-independent translation control sequence, for example, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). When used in appropriate viral expression systems, the translation of each peptide encoded by the mRNA is directed internally in the transcript, for example, by the IRES. Thus, the polycistronic construct directs the transcription of a single, large polycistronic mRNA which, in turn, directs the translation of multiple, individual peptides. This approach eliminates the production and enzymatic processing of polyproteins and can significantly increase yield of peptide driven by a single promoter.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0171">A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the peptides described herein. These include, but are not limited to, microorganisms such as bacteria transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA or plasmid DNA expression vectors containing an appropriate coding sequence; yeast or filamentous fungi transformed with recombinant yeast or fungi expression vectors containing an appropriate coding sequence; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing an appropriate coding sequence; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) or tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing an appropriate coding sequence; or animal cell systems.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0172">The expression elements of the expression systems vary in their strength and specificities. Depending on the host/vector system utilized, any of a number of suitable transcription and translation elements, including constitutive and inducible promoters, can be used in the expression vector. For example, when cloning in bacterial systems, inducible promoters such as pL of bacteriophage &#x3bb;, plac, ptrp, ptac (ptrp-lac hybrid promoter) and the like can be used. When cloning in insect cell systems, promoters such as the baculovirus polyhedron promoter can be used. When cloning in plant cell systems, promoters derived from the genome of plant cells (e.g., heat shock promoters, the promoter for the small subunit of RUBISCO, the promoter for the chlorophyll a/b binding protein) or from plant viruses (e.g., the 35S RNA promoter of CaMV, the coat protein promoter of TMV) can be used. When cloning in mammalian cell systems, promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter, the vaccinia virus 7.5 K promoter) can be used.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">C. Purification</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0173">The peptides or peptide analogs of the disclosure can be purified by many techniques well known in the art, such as reverse phase chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, affinity chromatography, gel electrophoresis, and the like. The actual conditions used to purify a particular multi-domain peptide or peptide analog will depend, in part, on synthesis strategy and on factors such as net charge, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and the like, and will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0174">For affinity chromatography purification, any antibody which specifically binds the multi-domain peptide or peptide analog may be used. For the production of antibodies, various host animals, including but not limited to, rabbits, mice, rats, and the like, may be immunized by injection with a multi-domain peptide or peptide analog. The multi-domain peptide or peptide analog can be attached to a suitable carrier (e.g., BSA) by means of a side chain functional group or linker attached to a side chain functional group. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, including but not limited to, Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels (e.g., aluminum hydroxide), surface active substances (e.g., lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, and oil emulsions), keyhole limpet hemocyanin, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacilli Calmette-Guerin) and <i>Corynebacterium parvum. </i></p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0175">Booster injections can be given at regular intervals, and antiserum harvested when the antibody titer thereof, as determined semi-quantitatively, for example, by double immunodiffusion in agar against known concentrations of the antigen, begins to fall. See, e.g., Ouchterlony et al., <i>Handbook of Experimental Immunology</i>, Wier, D. (ed.), Chapter 19, Blackwell, 1973. A plateau concentration of antibody is usually in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/ml of serum (about 12 &#x3bc;M). Affinity of the antisera for the antigen is determined by preparing competitive binding curves, as described, for example, by Fisher (<i>Manual of Clinical Immunology</i>, Ch. 42, 1980).</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0176">Monoclonal antibodies to a peptide or peptide analog may be prepared using any technique which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture, for example the classic method of Kohler &#x26; Milstein (<i>Nature </i>256:495-97, 1975), or a derivative method thereof. Briefly, a mouse is repetitively inoculated with a few micrograms of the selected protein immunogen (e.g., a multi-domain peptide or peptide analog) over a period of a few weeks. The mouse is then sacrificed, and the antibody-producing cells of the spleen isolated. The spleen cells are fused by means of polyethylene glycol with mouse myeloma cells, and the excess unfused cells destroyed by growth of the system on selective media comprising aminopterin (HAT media). The successfully fused cells are diluted and aliquots of the dilution placed in wells of a microtiter plate where growth of the culture is continued. Antibody-producing clones are identified by detection of antibody in the supernatant fluid of the wells by immunoassay procedures, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as originally described by Engvall (<i>Meth. Enzymol., </i>70:419-39, 1980), or a derivative method thereof. Selected positive clones can be expanded and their monoclonal antibody product harvested for use. Detailed procedures for monoclonal antibody production are described in Harlow and Lane, <i>Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual</i>, CSHL, New York, 1999. Polyclonal antiserum containing antibodies can be prepared by immunizing suitable animals with a polypeptide comprising at least one multi-domain peptide or peptide analog, which can be unmodified or modified, to enhance immunogenicity.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0177">Antibody fragments may be used in place of whole antibodies and may be readily expressed in prokaryotic host cells. Methods of making and using immunologically effective portions of monoclonal antibodies, also referred to as &#x201c;antibody fragments,&#x201d; are well known and include those described in Better &#x26; Horowitz, <i>Methods Enzymol. </i>178:476-96, 1989; Glockshuber et al., <i>Biochemistry </i>29:1362-67, 1990; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,237 (Expression of Functional Antibody Fragments); U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778 (Single Polypeptide Chain Binding Molecules); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,030 (Immunotherapy Using Single Chain Polypeptide Binding Molecules), and references cited therein. Conditions whereby a polypeptide/binding agent complex can form, as well as assays for the detection of the formation of a polypeptide/binding agent complex and quantitation of binding affinities of the binding agent and polypeptide, are standard in the art. Such assays can include, but are not limited to, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunomagnetic assays, ELISA, ELISPOT (Coligan et al., <i>Current Protocols in Immunology</i>, Wiley, N.Y., 1995), agglutination assays, flocculation assays, cell panning, etc., as are well known to one of skill in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">VI. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Uses Thereof</heading>
<p id="p-0168" num="0178">The peptides or peptide analogs of the disclosure (and mixtures thereof) can be used to treat any disorder in animals, especially mammals (e.g., humans), for which promoting lipid efflux is beneficial, including promoting lipid efflux without inducing hypertriglyceridemia or with reduced hypertriglyceridemia. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, hyperlipidemia (e.g., hypercholesterolemia), cardiovascular disease (e.g., atherosclerosis), restenosis (e.g., atherosclerotic plaques), peripheral vascular disease, acute coronary syndrome, reperfusion myocardial injury, and the like. The peptides or peptide analogs of the disclosure can also be used during the treatment of thrombotic stroke and during thrombolytic treatment of occluded coronary artery disease. In some examples, peptides or peptide analogs including lipid efflux activity and lipoprotein lipase activating activity, such as a peptide with an amino acid sequence provided by any one of SEQ ID NOs: 70-75, can be used to treat any of the aforementioned disorders.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0179">The peptides or peptide analogs can be used alone or in combination therapy with other lipid lowering compositions or drugs used to treat the foregoing conditions, or with agents (such as peptides) that activate LPL activity. Such combination therapies include, but are not limited to simultaneous or sequential administration of the drugs involved. For example, in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia or atherosclerosis, the peptide or peptide analog formulations can be administered with any one or more of the cholesterol lowering therapies currently in use, for example, bile-acid resins, niacin and statins.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0180">In other embodiments, the multi-domain peptide or peptide analog formulations can be administered with a lipoprotein lipase activating agent, such as an apoC-II protein, variant or fragment thereof, to prevent, reduce or inhibit hypertriglyceridemia associated with the administration of any of the disclosed peptides or peptide analogs.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0181">In another embodiment, the multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs can be used in conjunction with statins or fibrates to treat hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia and/or cardiovascular disease, such as atherosclerosis. In yet another embodiment, the multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs of the disclosure can be used in combination with an anti-microbials agent and/or an anti-inflammatory agent. In a further embodiment, the multi-domain peptides can also be expressed in vivo, by using any of the available gene therapy approaches.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">A. Administration of Peptides or Peptide Analogs</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0182">In some embodiments, multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs can be isolated from various sources and administered directly to the subject. For example, a multi-domain peptide or peptide analog can be expressed in vitro, such as in an <i>E. coli </i>expression system, as is well known in the art, and isolated in amounts useful for therapeutic compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0183">In exemplary applications, therapeutic compositions are administered to a subject suffering from a dyslipidemic or vascular disorder, such as hyperlipidemia, hyperlipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, HDL deficiency, apoA-I deficiency, coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, thrombotic stroke, peripheral vascular disease, restenosis, acute coronary syndrome, or reperfusion myocardial injury, in an amount sufficient to inhibit or treat the dyslipidemic or vascular disorder. Amounts effective for this use will depend upon the severity of the disorder and the general state of the subject's health. A therapeutically effective amount of the compound is that which provides either subjective relief of a symptom(s) or an objectively identifiable improvement as noted by the clinician or other qualified observer.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0184">A multi-domain peptide or peptide analog can be administered by any means known to one of skill in the art (see, e.g., Banga, &#x201c;Parenteral Controlled Delivery of Therapeutic Peptides and Proteins,&#x201d; in <i>Therapeutic Peptides and Proteins</i>, Technomic Publishing Co., Inc., Lancaster, Pa., 1995), such as by intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection, but even oral, nasal, or anal administration is contemplated. In one embodiment, administration is by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. To extend the time during which the multi-domain peptide or peptide analog is available to inhibit or treat a dyslipidemic or vascular disorder, the multi-domain peptide or peptide analog can be provided as an implant, an oily injection, or as a particulate system. The particulate system can be a microparticle, a microcapsule, a microsphere, a nanocapsule, or similar particle (Banga, &#x201c;Parenteral Controlled Delivery of Therapeutic Peptides and Proteins,&#x201d; in <i>Therapeutic Peptides and Proteins</i>, Technomic Publishing Co., Inc., Lancaster, Pa., 1995).</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0185">In one specific, non-limiting example, a multi domain peptide is administered that includes one or more of the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 3-45 and 70-75. In another specific, non-limiting example, a multi domain peptide is administered that includes one or more of the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 3-45, which promotes lipid efflux, in combination with a lipoprotein lipase activating agent, such as an apoC-II protein, fragment or variant thereof (e.g., a peptide with an amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 63-69); such LPL activating agent need not be covalently linked, or even administered simultaneously with, the peptide that promotes lipid efflux.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">B. Administration of Nucleic Acid Molecules</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0186">In some embodiments where the therapeutic agent is composed entirely of gene-encoded amino acids, or a portion of it is so composed, administration of the multi-domain peptide or mixture of peptides, or the relevant portion, can be achieved by an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector (or combination of vectors) which is administered so that it becomes intracellular, for example, by use of a retroviral vector (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, DuPont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (see e.g., Joliot et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., </i>88:1864-1868, 1991). Alternatively, the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, for example, by homologous or non-homologous recombination.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0187">Use of a DNA expression vector (e.g., the vector pCDNA) is an example of a method of introducing the foreign cDNA into a cell under the control of a strong viral promoter (e.g., cytomegalovirus) to drive the expression. However, other vectors can be used. Other retroviral vectors (such as pRETRO-ON, BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, Calif.) also use this promoter but have the advantages of entering cells without any transfection aid, integrating into the genome of target cells only when the target cell is dividing. It is also possible to turn on the expression of a therapeutic nucleic acid by administering tetracycline when these plasmids are used. Hence these plasmids can be allowed to transfect the cells, then administer a course of tetracycline to achieve regulated expression.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0188">Other plasmid vectors, such as pMAM-neo (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, Calif.) or pMSG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) use the MMTV-LTR promoter (which can be regulated with steroids) or the SV10 late promoter (pSVL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) or metallothionein-responsive promoter (pBPV, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and other viral vectors, including retroviruses. Examples of other viral vectors include adenovirus, AAV (adeno-associated virus), recombinant HSV, poxviruses (vaccinia) and recombinant lentivirus (such as HIV). All these vectors achieve the basic goal of delivering into the target cell the cDNA sequence and control elements needed for transcription.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0189">Retroviruses have been considered a preferred vector for gene therapy, with a high efficiency of infection and stable integration and expression (Orkin et al., <i>Prog. Med. Genet. </i>7:130-142, 1988). A nucleic acid encoding the multi-domain peptide can be cloned into a retroviral vector and driven from either its endogenous promoter (where applicable) or from the retroviral LTR (long terminal repeat). Other viral transfection systems may also be utilized for this type of approach, including adenovirus, AAV (McLaughlin et al., <i>J. Virol. </i>62:1963-1973, 1988), vaccinia virus (Moss et al., <i>Annu. Rev. Immunol. </i>5:305-324, 1987), Bovine Papilloma virus (Rasmussen et al., <i>Methods Enzymol. </i>139:642-654, 1987) or members of the herpesvirus group such as Epstein-Barr virus (Margolskee et al., <i>Mol. Cell. Biol. </i>8:2837-2847, 1988).</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0190">In addition to delivery of a nucleic acid encoding the multi-domain peptide to cells using viral vectors, it is possible to use non-infectious methods of delivery. For instance, lipidic and liposome-mediated gene delivery has recently been used successfully for transfection with various genes (for reviews, see Templeton and Lasic, <i>Mol. Biotechnol., </i>11:175-180, 1999; Lee and Huang, <i>Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst., </i>14:173-206, 1997; and Cooper, <i>Semin. Oncol., </i>23:172-187, 1996). For instance, cationic liposomes have been analyzed for their ability to transfect monocytic leukemia cells, and shown to be a viable alternative to using viral vectors (De Lima et al., <i>Mol. Membr. Biol., </i>16:103-109, 1999). Such cationic liposomes can also be targeted to specific cells through the inclusion of, for instance, monoclonal antibodies or other appropriate targeting ligands (Kao et al., <i>Cancer Gene Ther., </i>3:250-256, 1996).</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">C. Representative Methods of Administration, Formulations and Dosage</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0191">The provided multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs, constructs, or vectors encoding such peptides, can be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (e.g., a phospholipid or other type of lipid) or vehicle for administration to human or animal subjects. In some embodiments, more than one multi-domain peptide or peptide analog can be combined to form a single preparation. The multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs can be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared using conventional pharmaceutical techniques. Such techniques include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient and the pharmaceutical carrier(s) or excipient(s). In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of a sterile liquid carrier, for example, water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets commonly used by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0192">In certain embodiments, unit dosage formulations are those containing a dose or unit, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the administered ingredient. It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, formulations encompassed herein may include other agents commonly used by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0193">The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein, including those for use in treating dyslipidemic and vascular disorders, may be administered through different routes, such as oral, including buccal and sublingual, rectal, parenteral, aerosol, nasal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, and topical. They may be administered in different forms, including but not limited to solutions, emulsions and suspensions, microspheres, particles, microparticles, nanoparticles, and liposomes. In one embodiment, multi-domain peptides or peptide analogs with suitable features of ABCA1-specificity and low cytotoxicity can be precomplexed with phospholipids or other lipids into either discoidal or spherical shape particles prior to administration to subjects.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0194">In another embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compositions locally to the area in need of treatment. This may be achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local or regional infusion or perfusion during surgery, topical application (e.g., wound dressing), injection, catheter, suppository, or implant (e.g., implants formed from porous, non-porous, or gelatinous materials, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes or fibers), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0195">In a specific embodiment, one or more of the disclosed peptides capable of promoting lipid efflux and activating lipoprotein lipase may be associated either by coating or impregnating an implant such as stent to treat a dyslipidemic or vascular disorder. These peptides are prepared and purified as described herein. In an example, the implant can be partially or completely coated with the peptide. For instance, the luminal surface of the implant may be coated with the peptide. Such configuration is believed to reduce atherosclerotic plaques in arteries often associated with atherosclerosis while minimizing the amount of coating material and time required to prepare the implant. The peptide may be attached to the implant by any chemical or mechanical bond or force, including linking agents. Alternatively, the coating may be directly linked (tethered) to the first surface, such as through silane groups. In other examples, the implant may be impregnated with at least one peptide by methods known to those of skill in the art so that multiple surfaces (such as the outer and inner surfaces) of the implant include the peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0196">In an additional embodiment, the implant may be coated or impregnated with materials in addition to the disclosed peptides to further enhance their bio-utility. Examples of suitable coatings are medicated coatings, drug-eluting coatings, hydrophilic coatings, smoothing coatings.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0197">In one embodiment, administration can be by direct injection at the site (or former site) of a tissue that is to be treated, such as the heart or the peripheral vasculature. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are delivered in a vesicle, in particular liposomes (see, e.g., Langer, <i>Science </i>249:1527-1533, 1990; Treat et al., in <i>Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer</i>, Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, N.Y., pp. 353-365, 1989).</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0198">In yet another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump can be used (see, e.g., Langer <i>Science </i>249:1527-1533, 1990; Sefton <i>Crit. Rev. Biomed. Eng. </i>14:201-240, 1987; Buchwald et al., <i>Surgery </i>88:507-516, 1980; Saudek et al., <i>N. Engl. J. Med. </i>321:574-579, 1989). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see, e.g., Ranger et al., <i>Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. </i>23:61-64, 1983; Levy et al., <i>Science </i>228:190-192, 1985; During et al., <i>Ann. Neurol. </i>25:351-356, 1989; and Howard et al., <i>J. Neurosurg. </i>71:105-112, 1989). Other controlled release systems, such as those discussed in the review by Langer (<i>Science </i>249:1527-1533, 1990), can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0199">The amount of the pharmaceutical compositions that will be effective depends on the nature of the disorder or condition to be treated, as well as the stage of the disorder or condition.

<p id="p-0193" num="0203">This example demonstrates the ability of synthetic peptides containing amphipathic helices to efflux lipid from ABCA1-expressing cells.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0204">HeLa cells stably transfected with human ABCA1 cDNA (ABCA1 cells) and HeLa cells transfected with only a hygromycin-resistant control plasmid (control cells) were produced and grown in &#x3b1;-modified Eagle's medium (&#x3b1;MEM) plus 10% fetal calf serum, as described by Remaley et al. (<i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </i>280:818-823, 2001). Cholesterol and phospholipid efflux was performed for 18 hours on noncholesterol-loaded cells radiolabeledwith either cholesterol or choline (Remaley et al., <i>Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. </i>17:1813-1821, 1997). Percentage efflux was calculated after subtracting the radioactive counts in the blank media (&#x3b1;MEM plus 1 mg/ml of BSA), and expressed as the percent of total radioactive counts removed from the cells during the efflux period.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0205">Cell fixation was performed by a 10 minute treatment with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), followed by three washes with blank media. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from cells into the media was measured enzymatically (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Ind.) and expressed, after subtraction of LDH released into blank media, as the percentage of total cell LDH. Total cell LDH was determined after cell solubilization with 1% Triton X-100.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0206">The 37pA peptide: DWLKAFYDKVAEKLKEAFPDWLKAFYDKVA EKLKEAF (SEQ ID NO: 1) was synthesized by a solid-phase procedure, using a Fmoc/DIC/HOBt protocol on a Biosearch 9600 peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). Both L-amino acid (L-37pA) and D-amino acid (D-37pA) enantiomers were synthesized. All peptides were purified to greater than 98% homogeneity by reverse-phase HPLC on an Aquapore RP-300 column.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0207">ABCA1 cells were used to assess the ability of apoA-I and synthetic peptides to efflux lipid from cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As previously described (Hamon et al., <i>Nat. Cell Biol. </i>2:399-406, 2000 and Remaley et al., <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </i>280:818-823, 2001), control cells do not efflux significant amounts of cholesterol and phospholipid to apoA-I, but do so after transfection with ABCA1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, B). The L-37pA peptide, which was synthesized with all L-amino acids and only has two amphipathic helices in contrast to the 10 present in apoA-I, effluxed approximately 2- to 4-fold more cholesterol and phospholipid from ABCA1 cells than from control cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C</figref>, D). Both the L-37pA peptide and apoA-I began to show saturation for lipid efflux at approximately the same protein concentration of 10 &#x3bc;g/ml, but because the L-37pA peptide is significantly smaller in molecular weight than apoA-I, this corresponds to a molar concentration of 2 &#x3bc;M for L-37pA and 0.36 &#x3bc;M for apoA-I. The 37pA peptide synthesized with all D-amino acids, D-37pA, was also effective in promoting cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from ABCA1 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1E</figref>, F). D-37pA had a similar dose-response curve as L-37pA, suggesting that there is not a need for a stereoselective interaction between the 37-pA peptide and the ABCA1 transporter for lipid efflux. Both L-37pA and D-37pA also consistently removed more cholesterol (5% at 40 &#x3bc;g/ml) and phospholipids (8% at 40 &#x3bc;g/ml) from control cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C-F</figref>) than did apoA-I (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, B).</p>

<p id="p-0199" num="0209">Cholesterol efflux from ABCA1 cells to apoA-I was first detectable after 2 hours and continued to increase throughout the 30 hour efflux period (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). In contrast, there was no significant increase above background in cholesterol efflux to apoA-I from control cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). Overall, the kinetics for cholesterol efflux to L-37pA from ABCA1 cells was similar to that of apoA-I, except that cholesterol efflux was first detectable after 30 minutes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). L-37pA peptide, unlike apoA-I, also promoted cholesterol efflux from control cells but at approximately half the rate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). A small amount of cholesterol efflux to L-37pA from control cells was first detectable at 30 minutes, and then it slowly continued to increase throughout the efflux period, similar to what was observed for L-37pA with ABCA1 cells.</p>

<heading id="h-0026" level="1">Importance of Amphipathic a Helices</heading>
<p id="p-0200" num="0210">This example demonstrates the importance of amphipathic &#x3b1; helices in peptide-lipid affinity and in the ability of peptides to promote lipid efflux from cells.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0211">The introduction of D-amino acids into a peptide that otherwise contains L-amino acids is known to interfere with the ability of a peptide to form an alpha helix (Chen et al., <i>J. Pept. Res. </i>59:18-33, 2002). In order to test the importance of amphipathic alpha helices in peptide lipid affinity and in the ability of peptides to promote lipid efflux from cells, the following 2 peptides with the same sequence as 37pA were made with a mixture of L- and D-amino acids: (1) L2D-37pA, all L-amino acids except that D-amino acids were used for valine and tyrosine; and (2) L3D-37pA, all L-amino acids except that D-amino acids were used for alanine, lysine, and aspartic acid. The L2D-37pA and L3D-37pA peptides had lower lipid affinity, as assessed by monitoring their ability to act as detergents in the solubilization of dimyristoyl phosphatidyl choline (DMPC) vesicles. The solubilization of multilamellar DMPC vesicles (2 mg/ml) by the peptides (0.4 mg/ml) was performed in the presence of 8.5% NaBr, and the absorbance at 350 nm was measured after a 2 hour incubation at room temperature, as previously described (Jonas, <i>Methods of Enzymology </i>128:553-581, 1986). After the 2 hour incubation, the L-37pA and D-37pA peptides nearly completely solubilized the DMPC vesicles, whereas the L3D-37pA peptide caused only a minimal decrease in turbidity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The L2D-37pA peptide and apoA-I caused an intermediate level of DMPC vesicle solubilization compared to the L-37pA and L3D-37pA peptides.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0212">When the L2D-37pA peptide was tested for lipid efflux, the substitution of D-amino acids for valine and tyrosine residues caused a greater than 75% reduction in cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from ABCA1 cells compared to the L-37pA peptide, which contains all L-amino acids (Compare <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C</figref>, D). Even though lipid efflux was reduced from ABCA1 cells to the L2D-37pA peptide compared to apoA-1, the peptide still retained some ability to efflux lipid from ABCA1 cells, but it was unable, like apoA-I, to promote any lipid efflux from control cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, B). In contrast, L3D-37pA, which caused only minimal DMPC vesicle solubilization (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), was also unable to promote detectable amounts of lipid efflux from either ABCA1 cells or control cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). A peptide based on the gamma crystalline protein (RMRITERDDFRGQMSEITDDCPSLQDRFHLTEVHSLRVLEGS (SEQ ID NO: 2); Hay et al., Biochem <i>Biophys. Res. Commun. </i>146:332-338, 1987), which contains two non-amphipathic alpha helices of approximately the same length as the helices on 37pA, was tested and also found to be completely ineffective in promoting cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from either cell line. These results are consistent with previous studies that demonstrated the importance of the amphipathic alpha helix in promoting lipid efflux (see, e.g., Gillotte et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>274:2021-2028, 1999 and Gillotte et al., <i>J. of Lipid Res. </i>39:1918-1928, 1998). However, the relative level of lipid efflux from the two cell lines (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>) demonstrates that amphipathic helical peptides can promote lipid efflux in an ABCA1-dependent and an ABCA1-independent manner, although the expression of ABCA1 is necessary for those apolipoproteins and peptides, such as apoA-I and L2D-37pA, with only moderate lipid affinity, as assessed by DMPC vesicle solubilization (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<heading id="h-0027" level="1">Example 4</heading>
<heading id="h-0028" level="1">Evaluation of the ABCA1-Independent Lipid Efflux Pathway</heading>
<p id="p-0203" num="0213">This example demonstrates that amphipathic helical peptides with high lipid affinity can promote lipid efflux in an ABCA1-independent manner.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0214">In order to confirm that the residual lipid efflux from the control cells to L-37pA and D-37pA (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) was not due to a low level of endogenous ABCA1, a Tangier disease fibroblast cell line with a truncated non-functional ABCA1 transporter (Remaley et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>96:12685-12690, 1999) was evaluated for lipid efflux (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). ApoA-I, L-37pA, and D-37pA all effluxed cholesterol from normal fibroblasts, but apoA-I did not efflux significant amounts of cholesterol from Tangier disease fibroblasts (see also, Francis et al., <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>96:78-87, 1995 and Remaley et al., <i>Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. </i>17:1813-1821, 1997). In contrast, both L-37pA and D-37pA were still able to efflux cholesterol from Tangier disease fibroblasts, albeit at a reduced level, thus confirming the ability of these peptides to efflux lipid from cells in the absence of ABCA1.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0215">The ABCA1-independent pathway for lipid efflux was further evaluated by examining the effect of cell fixation with paraformaldehyde on cholesterol efflux to apoA-I (A), L-37pA (L), and D-37pA (D) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In addition, 0.02% of taurodeoxycholate (T) was also tested for lipid efflux after 1 hour, in order to determine if a sublytic concentration of a simple detergent would also promote more lipid efflux from ABCA1 cells than from control cells. As expected, based on the ATP requirement of the ABCA1 transporter (Dean et al., <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>42:1007-1017, 2001; Mendez, <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>38:1807-1821, 1997), fixation of ABCA1 cells with paraformaldehyde completely blocked the ability of apoA-I to efflux cholesterol (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>). In contrast, cell fixation of ABCA1 cells only partially reduced cholesterol efflux to the L-37pA and D-37pA peptides; approximately 30% of the baseline cholesterol efflux was still retained after cell fixation. When cholesterol efflux was tested on non-fixed control cells, the level of cholesterol efflux to L-37pA and D-37pA was similar to the level obtained with fixed ABCA1 cells (compare <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6A</figref>). Furthermore, unlike ABCA1 cells, fixation of control cells did not further reduce cholesterol efflux to the two peptides (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). These results indicate that lipid efflux by the peptides from ABCA1 cells occurs by both an ABCA1-dependent and an ABCA1-independent pathway, whereas lipid efflux from control cells only occurs by the ABCA1-independent pathway, which is a passive, energy-independent process that does not require viable cells.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0216">The addition of a relatively low concentration (0.02%) of taurodeoxycholate to the cell culture efflux media for 1 hour did not alter the morphology of the cells, as assessed by light microscopy, but did result in a small amount of cholesterol efflux from ABCA1 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>), which slightly increased after fixation. Approximately the same amount of cholesterol efflux also occurred from control cells after the taurodeoxycholate treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). Nearly identical results were also obtained with several other detergents (TX-100, NP-40, CHAPS) when tested at sublytic concentrations. This indicates that ABCA1 promotes lipid efflux to amphipathic helical proteins but does not increase the overall propensity of cells to efflux lipids to simple detergents.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0217">The inability to completely block peptide mediated lipid efflux by cell fixation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and the correlation between DMPC vesicle solubilization by the peptides with lipid efflux (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>), suggests that lipid efflux from control cells occurs as the result of the microsolubilization of the cell membrane lipids by the detergent-like action of the amphipathic helices on the peptides. The microsolubilization of the plasma membrane of cells could, therefore, be potentially cytotoxic, but no morphologic effect was observed on the cells after incubation with the peptides or apoA-I, during the efflux experiments. Incubation of the cells with L-37pA and D-37pA at the maximum concentration and time used for the efflux studies (40 &#x3bc;g/ml for 18 hours) did, however, consistently result in the release of a small amount of LDH from both cell lines (control cells: L-37pA (6.1%&#xb1;0.2), D-37pA (6.6%&#xb1;0.1); ABCA1 cells: L-37pA (4.3%&#xb1;0.04), D-37pA (5.7%&#xb1;0.1)). In contrast, L2D-37pA, L3D-37pA, and apoA-1, which did not cause lipid efflux from control cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) and, therefore, appear to be incapable of effluxing lipid by the ABCA1-independent pathway, also did not cause any significant release of cell LDH above baseline (&#x3c;0.5%) from either cell line.</p>

<heading id="h-0030" level="1">Competition of Peptides/apoA-I for Binding of Radiolabeled L-37pA</heading>
<p id="p-0208" num="0218">This example demonstrates the lack of stereoselectivity in the binding of the 37pA peptide to either ABCA1 cells or control cells.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0219">The L-37pA peptide was labeled with <sup>125</sup>I using iodine monochloride. Confluent cells grown on 12-well plates were incubated for 3 hours at 4&#xb0; C. with the indicated concentration of the unlabeled competitor peptide in &#x3b1;MEM media plus 10 mg/ml of BSA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The cells were then washed three times and incubated for 1 hour at 4&#xb0; C. with 1 &#x3bc;g/ml of the radiolabeled L-37pA peptide dissolved in &#x3b1;MEM media plus 10 mg/ml of BSA. Cells were washed three times, and cell bound counts were determined after solubilization with 0.1 N NaOH.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0220">A two-step sequential competitive binding assay was performed in order to prevent any potentially interfering interaction of the radiolabeled peptide with the competitor proteins (Mendez et al., <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>94:1698-1705, 1994). The cells were first incubated with the competitor proteins for 3 hours, washed, and then the cell binding of the radiolabeled L-37 peptide was measured. At 8 &#x3bc;M, the maximum concentration tested, which is equivalent to the maximum peptide protein concentration of 40 &#x3bc;g/ml used in the lipid efflux studies (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the unlabelled L-37pA peptide blocked the binding of approximately 40% of the labeled L-37pA peptide (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>). D-37pA was similarly effective in competing for the binding of L-37pA, indicating a lack of stereoselectivity in the binding of the peptides to ABCA1 cells. L3D-37pA, in contrast, was completely ineffective in competing for the binding of L-37pA. L2D-37pA and apoA-I acted as intermediate competitors; they each reduced the binding of radiolabeled L-37pA to ABCA1 cells by approximately 30% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>). Control cells also showed relatively high specific binding of L-37pA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>), but in the absence of a competitor, the control cells bound 23% less radiolabeled L-37pA peptide than ABCA1 cells (control cells 27&#xb1;0.6 &#x3bc;mol/mg cell protein; ABCA1 cells 35&#xb1;2.2 &#x3bc;mol/mg cell protein). Similar to ABCA1 cells, unlabelled L-37pA and D-37pA competed equally well for the binding of radiolabeled L-37pA. In contrast, L2D-37pA and apoA-I were less effective in control cells than in ABCA1 cells for competing for the binding of radiolabeled L-37pA. At the maximum concentration tested, both peptides blocked less than 5% of the radiolabeled L-37pA from binding to control cells, similar to the result obtained with the inactive L3D-37pA peptide. Overall, these results indicate that there is a lack of stereoselectivity in the binding of the 37pA peptide to either ABCA1 cells or control cells and that the cell binding of the peptides is at least partly dependent upon their lipid affinity.</p>

<heading id="h-0032" level="1">Effect of Asymmetry in Lipid Affinity of Multi-Domain Amphipathic Peptides on Lipid Efflux and Cell Cytotoxicity</heading>
<p id="p-0211" num="0221">This example demonstrates that asymmetry in lipid affinity of multi-domain amphipathic peptides is an important structural determinant for specificity of ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux by multi-domain peptides.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0222">The 37pA peptide was modified by making 5 Ala substitutions for hydrophobic residues (F18, L14, L3, V10, F6) in either the C-terminal helix (5A) or both helices (10A). Reverse phase HPLC retention times closely correlated with their predicted lipid affinity, as calculated by the hydrophobic moment of the modified peptides (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Four additional peptides with 1 (L14, 1A), 2 (L14, F18, 2A), 3 (L14, F18, F6, 3A) and 4 (L14, F18, F6, V10, 4A) Ala substitutions in the C-terminal helix were also synthesized. The 37pA had the longest retention time and with each additional Ala substitution there was a decrease in lipid affinity based on the retention time (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0223">The 37pA peptide and all of the modified peptides were then tested for cytotoxicity, using a red blood cell hemolysis assay (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Similar to results previously observed via monitoring LDH release, the 37pA was found to be cytotoxic. Approximately 25% of the red blood cells were lysed after 1 hour at the maximum dose tested (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Overall, the modified peptides containing the Ala substitutions were less cytotoxic, and the degree of cytotoxicity closely correlated with the number of Ala substitutions. The 4A, and 5A peptides showed no appreciable hemolysis of the red blood cells, whereas the 1A, 2A and 3A peptides showed a moderate degree of hemolysis when compared to 37pA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Based on these results, the optimum hydrophobic moment score per residue for the amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix with relatively low lipid affinity, in terms of reducing cytotoxicity, is less than about 0.34 (Eisenberg et al., <i>PNAS </i>81:140-144, 1984 and Eisenberg et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>179:125-142, 1984).</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0224">The 37pA peptide and the modified peptides were also tested for their specificity for cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 transporter (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). The 37pA peptide promoted ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, but it was also able to mediate cholesterol efflux from a control HeLa cell line that does not express the ABCA1 transporter. When cholesterol efflux was performed with the modified peptides, they were observed to have two different features than the 37pA peptide. First, there was a progressive rightward shift in the dose response curve with the Ala substitutions compared to the 37pA peptide. A greater concentration of the modified peptides was needed to get the maximum amount of cholesterol efflux. In addition, the percent of total cholesterol efflux attributable to the ABCA1 transporter progressively increased by making the Ala substitutions in the 37pA peptide. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that this is due to the fact that the modified peptides still retained their ability to remove cholesterol from the ABCA1-transfected cells, but were less effective in removing cholesterol from the control cells via non-ABCA1 cholesterol efflux pathways. The 5A peptide was completely specific for only causing cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 transporter. Based on these results, the optimum hydrophobic moment score (Eisenberg scale; 100 degree-alpha helix) per residue for the amphipathic helix with relatively low lipid affinity, in terms of AB CA1-specificity for cholesterol efflux, is between about 0.1 and about 0.33.</p>

<p id="p-0221" num="0231">Peptides can be tested for cytotoxicity by any number of methods well known to one of skill in the art, such as the release of intracellular LDH (Example 4) or the release of hemoglobin from red blood cells (Example 6). Such studies are performed by incubating various concentrations of the peptides with a cell line, a vesicle or red blood cells, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0232">Peptide ABCA1-Specificity for Lipid Efflux:</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0233">Peptides to be tested can be added to serum-free cell culture media in the approximate concentration range of 1-20 micromolar and incubated with a control cell line that does not express the ABCA1 transporter and the same cell line after transfection with human cDNA for the ABCA1 transporter, as described herein. Alternatively, cells, such as macrophages, that either express or do not express the ABCA1 transporter depending on their cholesterol content and/or exposure to agents that induce the ABCA1 transporter (e.g., cAMP and LXR agonists) can also be used. After a suitable period of approximately 4 to 24 hours, the conditioned media can be removed from the cells and the amount of cholesterol and or phospholipid effluxed can be quantified, as described herein. ABCA1-specific lipid efflux is calculated by subtracting the total lipid efflux from the ABCA1 expressing cell line from the results obtained from the cell line that does not express the ABCA1 transporter.</p>

<heading id="h-0036" level="1">In Vivo Effects of 5A-Peptide in Mice</heading>
<p id="p-0224" num="0234">This example illustrates the in vivo effects of 5A-POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine) peptide in mice.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0235">The 5A peptide (SEQ ID NO: 3) was complexed with POPC at a 1:7 molar ratio using a co-lyophilization procedure by which the free peptide and POPC were co-dissolved in glacial acetic acid and lypophilized. The dry powder was reconstituted with saline and heated between 37&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C. to reconstitution, which results in a clear solution of particles containing both the 5A peptide and POPC.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0236">Increasing concentrations (3.75 mg/kg; 7.5 mg/kg; 15 mg/kg; 30 mg/kg; 60 mg/kg; 120 mg/kg; or 240 mg/kg) of 5A-POPC peptide were administered intravenously to wild-type mice over a 24 hour period. Plasma cholesterol levels were then measured. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a dose response relationship between total cholesterol and the 5A peptide was observed. Based on fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) analysis, almost all of this increase in cholesterol was due to an increase in the cholesterol content of HDL, which is consistent with the ability of the peptide to in vitro promote cholesterol efflux from cells.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0237">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, treatment of mice with the 5A peptide (SEQ ID NO: 3) reduced atherosclerosis. Treatment with the 5A peptide also appeared to be non-toxic based on measurement of various serum biomarkers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). However, 5A peptide caused a transient increase in triglycerides (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>). Similar effects on triglycerides have also been measured for apoA-I and various apoA-I mimetic peptides.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0238">Hypertriglyceridemia is a side effect of various drugs and can be due to liver toxicity, but it often occurs after chronic administration of the drug and is persistent. In this case, the hypertriglyceridemia occurred almost immediately after administration of the peptide and was transient (less than 8 hours) and there was no evidence of increased markers of liver damage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). FPLC analysis indicated that the increase in triglycerides occurred on VLDL, which may be a consequence of the ability of the 5A peptide to induce reverse cholesterol transport back to the liver and stimulate VLDL secretion.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0239">Additional studies (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>) indicated that the increase in triglycerides was due to inhibition of lipoprotein lipase, the main serum enzyme that hydrolyzes triglycerides on VLDL and chylomicrons. First, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the increase in triglycerides was significant in non-fasting mice (i.e., over a 10-fold increase was observed and the reactant level of serum triglycerides exceeded 1000 mg/dL). In contrast, triglyceride levels in fasting mice were only increased by 3-fold (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, increasing doses of the 5A peptide led to no significant changes in triglycerides synthesis in mice treated with Triton-WR 1339 (a detergent that inhibits lipoprotein lipase). These studies suggest that the hypertriglyceridemia observed after 5A injection resulted from decreased catabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0240">In the saline treated mice, there was a time dependent increase in triglycerides. When the mice were also treated with the 5A peptide there was also an increase in triglycerides but compared to mice not treated with Triton-X (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>), the increase over the saline control was not as large and was not statistically significant. This would be expected if both the 5A peptide and Triton-X inhibit lipoprotein lipase. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the direct effect of the 5A peptide was tested on lipoprotein lipase, using an in vitro assay. Using doses similar to those which caused hypertriglyceridemia in mice, it was found that the 5A peptide was a potent inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase revealing the mechanism by which 5A peptide caused hypertriglyceridemia.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0241">These studies demonstrate that while 5A-POPC peptide stimulates cholesterol efflux in mice in vivo, it also inhibits lipoprotein lipase leading to transient hypertriglyceridemia. These studies also reveal a new use of the 5A peptide as a lipoprotein lipase inhibitor.</p>

<heading id="h-0038" level="1">In Vivo Effects of 18A-C-II Peptide in Mice</heading>
<p id="p-0232" num="0242">This example illustrates the ability of 18A-C-II peptide to reduce triglycerides and cholesterol plasma levels in normal and dyslipidemic mice.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0243">18A-C-II peptide (SEQ ID NO: 70) was complexed with POPC at a 1:7 molar ratio using a co-lyophilization procedure by which the free peptide and POPC were co-dissolved in glacial acetic acid and lypophilized. The dry powder was reconstituted with saline and heated between 37&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C. to reconstitution, which results in a clear solution of particles containing both the 18A-C-II peptide and POPC.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0244">Hypertriglyceridemia was induced in C57B1/6 mice by a 2 mg (60 mg/kg) bolus IV injection of free 5A peptide (A). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, when 1 mg (30 mg/kg) of the 18A-C-II peptide was co-injected with free 5A peptide (X), the increase in plasma triglycerides was significantly reduced. In addition, a single IV dose of 1 mg of the 18A-C-II:POPC peptide lowered the plasma triglyceride levels in normal C57B1 mice (&#x25a1;) compared to saline (&#x22c4;). Additionally, a single dose of 30 mg/kg (1 mg) of 18A-C-II:POPC peptide significantly reduced plasma triglyceride levels in ApoE knockout mice (76%) when compared to baseline values (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0245">In order to investigate the effects of the 18A-C-II peptide in plasma cholesterol of C57B1/6 mice, mice were injected with an IV bolus of 1 mg (30 mg/kg) of 18A-C-II:POPC and plasma cholesterol levels were monitored for 4 hours. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a significant reduction in plasma cholesterol of 52% and 80% was observed after 1 hour and 4 hours of the treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0246">ApoE knockout and LDLR knockout mice are characterized by high plasma levels of VLDL/IDL and LDL respectively. To evaluate the potential to reduce the plasma cholesterol levels, mice were injected IV in bolus with a dose of 1 mg (30 mg/kg) of the lipidated 18A-C-II:POPC in ApoE KO (&#x22c4;) and 0.5 mg (15 mg/kg) in LDLR KO mice (&#x25a1;). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, a significant reduction (36%) in serum cholesterol in ApoE KO mice was observed, while the low dose of the peptide in LDLR KO mice showed a reduction of 22% in plasma cholesterol after 2 hours of the treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0247">The changes observed in plasma cholesterol and triglycerides were further analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, a dose of 30 mg/kg of 18A-C-II:POPC (1:7) peptide lead to reduction of LDL-c, HDL-c (left panel) as well as VLDL-tg, LDL-tg and HDL-tg (right panel) at 1 and 4 hours after treatment. (LDL-c=LDL cholesterol; tg=triglycerides). Each sample represents a pool of 3 mice.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0248">The effect of 18A-C-II peptide on cholesterol efflux was investigated by loading BHK and BHK-ABCA1 cells with <sup>3</sup>H-cholesterol for 24 hours at 37&#xb0; C. and then adding 20 ug/ml of the free 18A-C-II peptide as cholesterol acceptor to efflux for 18 hours. Percentage efflux was calculated by subtracting the radioactive counts in the blank from the radioactive counts in the presence of an acceptor and then dividing the result by the sum of the radioactive counts in the medium plus the cell fraction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, a significant difference was observed in cells that express the ABCA1 transporter indicating that ABCA1 is, at least, one mechanism mediating the cholesterol efflux to the 18A-C-II peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0249">These studies show that the 18A-C-II peptide produces plasma changes in triglycerides similar to the native human protein. The 18A-C-II peptide was able to reduce and to prevent the increase of triglycerides in plasma of normal and dyslipidemic mice. The 18A-C-II peptide was also able to reduce plasma cholesterol levels in normal and dyslipidemic mice. The reduction of cholesterol and triglycerides was seen in all lipoproteins. The efflux mediated by the 18A-C-II peptide is, at least, in part mediated by the ABCA-1 transporter. Altogether, the reduced triglycerides and cholesterol plasma levels observed is compatible to an athero-protective and to an anti-metabolic syndrome profile.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0250">The ability of the 18A-C-II peptide in reducing triglycerides is believed to be useful to treat conditions that lead to hypertriglyceridemia such as pancreatitis, metabolic syndrome, LPL deficiency, and high triglycerides induced by apoA-I mimetic therapies. Moreover, the cholesterol lowering effect is believed to be a potential new alternative treatment to conditions such as familial hypercholesterolemia and other high cholesterol dyslipidemias.</p>

<heading id="h-0040" level="1">Identification of Peptides that Promote ABCA1-Dependent Lipid Efflux and Activate Lipoprotein Lipase</heading>
<p id="p-0241" num="0251">This example illustrates a method for identifying peptides that promote ABCA1-dependent lipid efflux from cells and activates lipoprotein lipase within cells.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0252">Peptide Design:</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0253">Based on the principals and procedures described in the present application, an amino acid sequence can be designed for a peptide that promotes lipid efflux and is capable of activating lipoprotein lipase. In one example, the peptide contains one amphipathic &#x3b1;-helix, with relatively high lipid affinity, and an apoC-II domain (such as those provided in Table 3 above). The apoC-II domain can be in the form of an &#x3b1;-helix resulting in a peptide with two &#x3b1;-helices. Alternatively, the apoC-II domain can be incorporated into one or more of the amphipathic &#x3b1;-helical domains of the multi-domain peptides designed and produced according to methods disclosed herein (such as those provided in Example 7).</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0254">Peptide Production:</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0255">Peptides to be tested can be produced synthetically or by recombinant DNA methods, as described in the present application, and purified by reverse phase HPLC or other suitable techniques well known to one of skill in the art. In a particular example, the peptide provided in Table 4 can be synthesized and purified.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0256">Peptide Cytotoxicity Testing:</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0257">Peptides can be tested for cytotoxicity by any number of methods well known to one of skill in the art, such as the release of intracellular LDH (Example 4), the release of hemoglobin from red blood cells (Example 6) or evaluating the in vivo effects of the peptide on various serum biomarkers (Example 8) or triglyceride levels. Such studies are performed by incubating various concentrations of the peptides with a cell line, a vesicle or red blood cells, or administrating various concentrations of the peptide to the subject as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0258">Peptide ABCA1-Specificity for Lipid Efflux:</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0259">Peptides to be tested can be added to serum-free cell culture media in the approximate concentration range of 1-20 micromolar (&#x3bc;M) and incubated with a control cell line that does not express the ABCA1 transporter and the same cell line after transfection with human cDNA for the ABCA1 transporter, as described herein. Alternatively, cells, such as macrophages, that either express or do not express the ABCA1 transporter depending on their cholesterol content and/or exposure to agents that induce the ABCA1 transporter (e.g., cAMP and LXR agonists) can also be used. After a suitable period of approximately 4 to 24 hours, the conditioned media can be removed from the cells and the amount of cholesterol and or phospholipid effluxed can be quantified, as described herein. ABCA1-specific lipid efflux is calculated by subtracting the total lipid efflux from the ABCA1 expressing cell line from the results obtained from the cell line that does not express the ABCA1 transporter. To determine the ability of peptides to stimulate lipid efflux in vivo, increasing concentrations (3.75 mg/kg; 7.5 mg/kg; 15 mg/kg; 30 mg/kg; 60 mg/kg; 120 mg/kg; or 240 mg/kg) of the peptide can be administered intravenously to wild-type mice over a 24 hour period. Plasma cholesterol levels can then be measured.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0260">Peptide Activation of Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL):</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0261">For measurement of LPL activity an assay mixture of 200 &#x3bc;l containing 2 mg of triacylglycerols from the lipid emulsion can be used. The medium can contain 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris-Cl, 20 &#x3bc;g of heparin, and 12 mg of bovine serum albumin (pH 8.5). To study the activation, peptides can be dissolved in 5 M urea, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.2). Known activators of LPL, such as apoC-II, can be used as a positive control. The protein concentration can be determined by a bicinchoninic acid protein assay. Five &#x3bc;l of the stock solution of apoC-II, or the same volume of dilutions in 5 M urea, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.2), can be added to the incubations. The reactions can be started by addition of LPL and stopped after incubation for 15 min at 25&#xb0; C. by addition of organic solvents for extraction of the labeled free fatty acids. The lipase activity is expressed in units/mg of LPL, where 1 unit corresponds to release of 1 &#x3bc;mol of fatty acid per minute. An at least 10% increase in LPL activity and or a statistically significant increase (3&#xd7; the CV of the lipase assay) in LPL activity in the presence of a test peptide as compared to LPL activity in the absence of the test peptide, identifies the peptide as an LPL activating peptide. The ability of the test peptides to activate LPL in vivo, can be determined by administering one or more of the peptides. Triglycerides levels in a sample taken from a subject receiving the peptide alone can then be compared to those levels present in a sample taken prior to the subject receiving the peptide or compared to a reference sample containing a known amount of triglycerides. Triglyceride levels of less than 150 mg/dl following peptide administration indicate that the peptide is an LPL activator.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the field of immunogenic compositions for the prevention of HIV infection.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">More than 60 million people worldwide have been infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and nearly half have died of the resultant Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) since 1981. About 2.7 million new infections were reported in 2007. Therefore, development of an effective and safe HIV vaccine is urgently needed to contain the spread of HIV and AIDS. However, most previous efforts to achieve this goal have failed. Clinical trials of the first T-cell vaccine (Merck's MRKAd5 HIV-1 gag/pol/nef trivalent vaccine) were terminated recently because the data showed that the vaccine was unable to prevent HIV infection and could not lower virus levels in vaccinated volunteers who became infected. The first B-cell vaccine (VaxGen's AIDSVax, a bivalent gp120-based subunit vaccine) tested in clinical trials also failed to protect volunteers from HIV infection, possibly due to its inability to elicit broad neutralizing antibody responses because of great variability and high glycosylation of gp120. Since the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) transmembrane subunit gp41 has relatively conserved sequence and less glycosylation sites than gp120, it may be a better target than gp120 for vaccine development. Indeed, two human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting gp41, 2F5 and 4E10, exhibit much broader neutralizing activity than those targeting gp120 (mAbs 2G12 and b12).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">HIV-1 gp41 (SEQ ID NO. 2) plays an essential role in virus fusion with the target cell. HIV-1 pg41 consists of three essential functional regions: fusion peptide (FP), N-terminal heptad repeat (called NHR or HR1, which refer to the same sequence and are considered equivalent as used herein) and C-terminal heptad repeat (called CHR or HR2, which refer to the same sequence and are considered equivalent as used herein) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). Both NHR and CHR contain a number of leucine zipper-like motifs which have tendency to form coiled coil structures. Peptides derived from the NHR and CHR regions are effective in inhibiting HIV-1 fusion with the target cells and one of the CHR-peptides, enfuvirtide was licensed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2003 as the first member of a new class of anti-HIV drugs-HIV fusion inhibitors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">HIV fusion with the host cell is initiated by binding of Env surface subunit 120 to the primary receptor CD4 and a co-receptor, CXCR4 or CCR5, resulting in a series of conformational changes in gp41, including insertion of FP into the target cell membrane and association of CHR-helices with the NHR-trimer, a prehairpin intermediate, to form a stable six-helix bundle (6-HB) core, which bring the viral envelope and target cell membrane into close proximity for fusion. X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that 6-HB consists of three molecules of a NHR-peptide that form the inner trimeric coiled-coil and three copies of a CHR-peptide that pack obliquely in an anti-parallel configuration into the highly conserved hydrophobic grooves on the surface of the internal NHR-trimer. Each groove has a deep hydrophobic pocket (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, circled at bottom), which plays an important role in viral fusion and maintaining the stability of the 6-HB. Accordingly, it is proposed that a CHR-peptide (e.g., enfuvirtide or C34) inhibits HIV-1 fusion by binding to the viral gp41 NHR-trimer at the fusion-intermediate state to block the formation of fusion-active core of gp41. Therefore, the gp41 NHR-trimer is a crucial target for HIV therapeutics, and may also serve as an important target for HIV vaccines.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the gp41 NHR-peptides cannot form stable and soluble trimers in vitro spontaneously because these peptides have tendency to aggregate in physiological solutions. To study the structure, function and immunogenicity of the gp41 prehairpin intermediate, several soluble and stable NHR-trimer mimetics have been created, including IQN17 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>), in which a 17-mer NHR-peptide (aa 565-581) involving in formation of the gp41 hydrophobic pocket is linked with GCN4-pI<sub>Q</sub>I (IQ) motif, a soluble trimeric coiled coil, and similar mimetics with higher stability, including IZN17, IZN36 and (ccIZN17)<sub>3</sub>, in which IQ is replaced with more stable trimerization motif, IZ. Other examples of NHR-trimer mimetics include NCCG-gp41, N35<sub>CCG</sub>-N13, and 5-Helix in which one CHR peptide of the 6-HB is missing so as to expose the groove of the NHR-trimer. Although all these NHR-trimer mimetics properly present the hydrophobic groove and pocket and are effective in interacting with viral gp41 CHR to inhibit HIV-1 fusion, none of them could induce detectable neutralizing antibody responses in immunized animals. It is believed that the accessibility of the prehairpin intermediate of gp41 to antibody molecules (e.g., IgG) is limited because antisera directed against NHR-peptides exhibited no neutralizing activity at 37&#xb0; C., but were effective under suboptimal temperature (31.5&#xb0; C.) to prolong fusion intermediates. But interestingly, IgG1 m44, a human mAb directed against gp41 is much more potent than Fab m44 in neutralizing infection by primary HIV-1 isolates. Another human mAb, D5, that specifically binds to the pocket of NHR-trimer is highly potent to neutralize HIV-1 infection. Although rabbit antisera induced against N35<sub>CCG</sub>-N13 showed no neutralizing activity, purified IgG from the antisera (about 5-10% of total IgGs) with high-binding affinity to the NHR-trimer could significantly inhibit HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion. These data suggest that the gp41 NHR-trimer in the prehairpin fusion intermediate state is accessible to antibodies, which is not restricted by either antibody size or the presence of a kinetic barrier, but may be limited by the affinity of antibodies to bind with the NHR-trimer. Therefore, it is essential to design an immunogen with proper conformation and increased immunogenicity that can induce antibodies with high-binding affinity to the gp41 prehairpin intermediate.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Host: As used herein &#x201c;host&#x201d; refers to the recipient of the present immunogenic compositions. Exemplary hosts are mammals including, but not limited to, primates, rodents, cows, horses, dogs, cats, sheep, goats, pigs and elephants. In one embodiment of the present invention the host is a human. For the purposes of this disclosure host is synonymous with &#x201c;vaccinee.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Immunogen: As used herein the term &#x201c;immunogen&#x201d; shall mean any substrate that elicits an immune response in a host. Immunogens of the present disclosure include, but are not limited to human immunodeficiency proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Immunogenic Composition: An &#x201c;immunogenic composition&#x201d; as used herein comprises an expressed protein or a recombinant vector, with or without an adjuvant, that expresses and/or secretes an immunogen in vivo and wherein the immunogen elicits an immune response in the host. The immunogenic compositions disclosed herein may or may not be immunoprotective or therapeutic. When the immunogenic compositions may prevent, ameliorate, palliate or eliminate disease from the host then the immunogenic composition may optionally be referred to as a vaccine. However, the term immunogenic composition is not intended to be limited to vaccines.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The term &#x201c;HIV fusion&#x201d; refers to a critical step of virus life cycle necessary for a virion or HIV-infected fusing with a target vesicle or cell.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">&#x201c;ND50&#x201d; refer to the antibody concentration or antiserum titer that results in a 50% neutralization, respectively, of virus infection.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">&#x201c;IC50 or EC50&#x201d; refer to the antibody concentration or antiserum titer that results in a 50% reduction or inhibition, respectively, in virus infection or virus-mediated cell-cell fusion.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR or HR1) alpha-helical trimer of HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) transmembrane subunit gp41 plays a crucial role in virus fusion with the target cell and represents an important target for therapeutics (e.g., enfuvirtide) and vaccines. Disclosed herein is a subunit immunogenic composition comprising a fusion protein comprising at least a portion of the HIV-1 gp41, a trimerization motif and an immunoenhancer. The immunogenic compositions disclosed herein may be administered in any formulations and with any adjuvant.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment the composition comprises a fusion protein comprising an NHR-peptide N46 (SEQ ID NO. 3) derived from the HIV-1 HXB2 (subtype B) gp41 (SEQ ID NO. 2), a trimerization motif foldon (Fd) (SEQ ID NO. 18), and the human immunoglobulin G Fc domain (hFc) (SEQ ID NO. 21) as an immunoenhancer, designated N46FdhFc (SEQ ID NO. 25). The N46 peptide and the recombinant protein without Fc, N46Fd (SEQ ID NO. 24) were used as controls. Unlike the N46 peptide and N46Fd, N46FdhFc elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses in the immunized mice against infection by laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 strains.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another embodiment, a fusion protein is provided comprising a gp41 NHR sequence derived from one of the following sequences: HIV-1 94UG103, subtype A (SEQ ID NO. 4); 92US657, subtype B (SEQ ID NO. 5); HIV-1 93IN101, subtype C (SEQ ID NO. 6); HIV-1 92UG001, subtype D (SEQ ID NO. 7); HIV-1 92THA009, subtype NE (SEQ ID NO. 8); HIV-1 93BR020, subtype F (SEQ ID NO. 9); HIV-1 RU570, subtype G (SEQ ID NO. 10); HIV-1 BCF02, group O (SEQ ID NO. 11); or from HIV-2 CBL20 (SEQ ID NO. 12), a trimerization motif and an immunoenhancer.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The fusion protein described herein comprises at least one gp41 NHR sequence derived from the entire NHR(HR1) region or from part of the NHR(HR1) region, e.g., N17 (SEQ ID NO. 13), N36 (SEQ ID NO. 14), N28 (SEQ ID NO. 15), N36 (SEQ ID NO. 16), N51 (SEQ ID NO. 17), or N63 (SEQ ID NO. 18) derived from HIV-1 HXB2 (subtype B).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The fusion protein described herein comprises at least one gp41 NHR(HR1) sequence from a lentivirus. Exemplary lentiviruses include, but are not limited to, any strain of HIV-1, HIV-2 or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the fusion protein described herein comprises an entire gp41 sequence from HIV-1 HXB2 (SEQ ID NO. 2). In another embodiment, the fusion protein comprises an entire gp41 sequence from HIV-1, HIV-2 or SIV.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Moreover, fusion proteins disclosed herein comprise a trimerization or oligomerization motif that includes, but is not limited to, foldon (SEQ ID NO. 18), IQ (the IQ calmodulin-binding motif, SEQ ID NO. 19), and IZ (isoleucine zipper motif, SEQ ID NO. 20), Foldon is a trimerization or oligomerization motif from the T4 bacteriophage fibritin. Additionally, the gp41 component and the immunoenhancer can be physically linked by 2,2-bipyridine-5-carboxylic acid or intramolecular disulfide bonds.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Additionally, the fusion proteins include an immunoenhancer that includes, but is not limited to, Fc fragment of human IgG (SEQ ID NO. 20), mouse IgG Fc (SEQ ID NO. 21), rabbit IgG Fc (SEQ ID NO. 22), C3d of human complement, or an immunomodulator, such as a cytokine.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the immunoenhancer is immunoglobulin Fc fragment. The immunoglobulin molecule consists of two light chains and two heavy chains held together by disulfide bonds such that the chains form a Y shape. The base of the Y (carboxy terminus of the heavy chain) plays a role in modulating immune cell activity. This region is called the Fc (fragment, crystallizable) region, and is composed of two heavy chains that contribute two or three constant domains depending on the class of the antibody. By binding to specific proteins, the Fc region ensures that each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for a given antigen. The Fc region also binds to various cell receptors, such as Fc receptors, and other immune molecules, such as complement proteins. By doing this, it mediates different physiological effects including opsonization, cell lysis, and degranulation of mast cells, basophils and eosinophils.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As used herein, nucleotide sequences which are substantially the same share at least about 90% identity, and amino acid sequences which are substantially the same typically share more than 95% amino acid identity. It is recognized, however, that proteins (and DNA or mRNA encoding such proteins) containing less than the above-described level of homology arising as splice variants or that are modified by conservative amino acid substitutions (or substitution of degenerate codons) are contemplated to be within the scope of the present disclosure. As readily recognized by those of skill in the art, various ways have been devised to align sequences for comparison, e.g., Blosum 62 scoring matrix, as described by Henikoff and Henikoff in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915 (1992). Algorithms conveniently employed for this purpose are widely available (see, for example, Needleman and Wunsch in J. Mol. Bio. 48:443 (1970).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Therefore, disclosed herein are amino acid sequences 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to SEQ ID NOs:1-32.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Also disclosed herein are conservative amino acid substitutions of amino acids sequences SEQ ID NOs:1-32. Conservative amino acids substitutions are defined as changed, which although they alter the primary sequence of the protein or peptide, do not normally alter its function. Conservative amino acid substitutions typically include substitutions within the following groups: glycine and alanine; valine, isoleucine, and leucine; aspartic acid and glutamic acid; asparagine and glutamine; serine and threonine; lysine and arginine; and phenylalanine and tyrosine.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, the claimed fusion proteins can be constructed using overlapping primers. In another embodiment, the DNA sequence (GGCTATATTCCG GAAGCGCCGCGTGATGGCCAGGCGTATGTGCGTAAAGATGGCGAATGGGTGCTG CTGTCTACCTTTCTG; SEQ ID NO:36) encoding Fd (aa sequence: GYIPEAPRDG QAYVRKDGEWVLLSTFL) is synthesized first. Separate PCR products of the gp41 sequence and Fd are generated and the gp41 segment-Fd fusion fragment is amplified by one-round PCR using a gp41 forward primer and Fd reverse primer with gp41 (or a fragment thereof) and Fd DNA (PCR products) as templates. The amplified gp41 segment-Fd PCR product is then inserted into the hFc vector, to get an gp41-Fd-hFc recombinant plasmid encoding gp41-Fd-hFc fusion proteins. For the purposes of this discussion, the term &#x201c;gp41&#x201d; or &#x201c;gp41 component&#x201d; refers to the full-length gp41 protein, or a fragment thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The gp41 component (gp41), trimerization or oligomerization motif component (TM) and the immunoenhancer component (1E) of the fusion proteins can be constructed in a variety of orientations including, but not limited to, gp41-TM-IE, gp41-IE-TM, IE-gp41-TM, TM-gp41-IE, etc. In one embodiment, the components are arranged gp41-TM-IE.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc (human Fc, hFc), pFUSE-mIgG2a-Fc2 (murine Fc, mFc), or pFUSE-rIgG2-Fc2 (rabbit Fc, rFc) vectors are used for construction of the disclosed fusion proteins. In another embodiment, the fusion proteins can be expressed from other mammalian cell expression vectors, including, but not limited to, pcDNA3.1, pcDNA6-His, PEE13.1, PEE1.41, pCMV-NEO-BAM, pSV2, and pCMV1,2,3,4,5,6. In another embodiment, the fusion proteins can be expressed from insect cell expression vectors including, but not limited to, pAcGP67, pFastBac Dual, and pMT/V5-His-TOPO. In yet another embodiment, the fusion proteins can be expressed from <i>E. coli </i>expression vectors including, but not limited to, pET, pET-SUMO, and pGEX vectors with GST.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The following expression systems are suitable for use in expressing the disclosed fusion proteins: mammalian cell expression systems such as, but not limited to, pcDNA expression system, and GS Gene expression system; insect cell expression systems such as, but not limited to, Bac-to-Bac expression system, baculovirus expression system and DES expression systems; and <i>E. coli </i>expression systems including, but not limited to, pET, pSUMO and GST expression systems.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Advantages of proteins expressed in mammalian cell expression systems include the follows. The mammalian cell expression system is a relatively mature eukaryotic system for expression of recombinant proteins. There is a far higher chance to get correctly folded soluble proteins with proper glycosylation, making the expressed protein maintain native conformation and keep sufficient bioactivity if necessary. This system can either transient or stable express recombinant antigens, and promote signal synthesis. Recombinant proteins expressed in this way may keep good antigenicity and immunogenicity. However, both insect and bacterial expression systems provide inexpensive and efficient expression of active proteins, particularly when glycosylation is not required for bioactivity.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The purification systems are dependent on whether a tag is linked or fused with the fusion proteins. When the fusion proteins are fused with IgG Fc vectors, Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography is used for the purification. If the fusion proteins are fused with GST proteins, the GST columns will be used for the purification. If the fusion proteins link with 6&#xd7;His tag at the N- or C-terminal, the expressed proteins are be purified using His tag columns. If no tag is linked with recombinant proteins, the expressed proteins re be purified using Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or other chromatographies.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In certain embodiments, the immunogenic compositions further comprise an adjuvant. Adjuvants suitable for use in animals include, but are not limited to, Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvants, Sigma Adjuvant System (SAS), and Ribi adjuvants. Adjuvants suitable for use in humans include, but are not limited to, MF59 (an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant), aluminum hydroxide, -phosphate or -oxide, HAVLOGEN&#xae; (an acrylic acid polymer-based adjuvant, Intervet Inc., Millsboro, Del.), polyacrylic acids, oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion based on, for example a mineral oil, such as BAYOL&#x2122; or MARCOL&#x2122; (Esso Imperial Oil Limited, Canada), or a vegetable oil such as vitamin E acetate, saponins, and Onchocerca volvulus activation-associated protein-1 (ASP-1) (see US 20060039921, which is incorporated by reference herein for all it discloses regarding ASP-1 adjuvants). However, components with adjuvant activity are widely known and, generally, any adjuvant may be utilized that does not adversely interfere with the efficacy or safety of the vaccine and/or immunogenic composition.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Vaccine and immunogenic compositions according to the various embodiments disclosed herein can be prepared and/or marketed in the form of a liquid, frozen suspension or in a lyophilized form. Typically, vaccines and/or immunogenic compositions prepared according to the present disclosure contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent customarily used for such compositions. Carriers include, but are not limited to, stabilizers, preservatives and buffers. Suitable stabilizers are, for example SPGA, Tween compositions (such as are available from A.G. Scientific, Inc., San Diego, Calif.), carbohydrates (such as sorbitol, mannitol, starch, sucrose, dextran, glutamate or glucose), proteins (such as dried milk serum, albumin or casein) or degradation products thereof. Non-limiting examples of suitable buffers include alkali metal phosphates. Suitable preservatives are thimerosal, merthiolate and gentamicin. Diluents include water, aqueous buffer (such as buffered saline), alcohols and polyols (such as glycerol).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Also disclosed herein are methods for inducing an immune response to HIV using the disclosed fusion proteins. Generally, the vaccine or immunogenic composition may be administered subcutaneously, intradermally, submucosally, or intramuscularly in an effective amount to prevent infection from HIV and/or treat an infection with HIV. An effective amount is defined as an amount of immunizing fusion protein that will induce immunity in the vaccinated animals, against challenge by a virulent virus. Immunity is defined herein as the induction of a significant higher level of protection in a population of the animal after vaccination compared to an unvaccinated group.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, in various formulations of the vaccines and/or immunogenic compositions, suitable excipients, stabilizers and the like may be added.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the HIV-1 HXB2 gp41 consists of an ectodomain, a transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic (CP) domains. The ectodomain contains: fusion peptide (FP); N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR), which has a pocket-forming sequence (underlined); Immunodominant (ID) loop; C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR), which contains a pocket-binding sequence (underlined); and a membrane proximal external region (MPER).

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Construction of Plasmids Encoding N46Fd and N46FdhFc</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The N46 sequence was derived from the NHR region of HIV-1HXB2 gp41. The pHXB2-env plasmid was employed as a template to synthesize a DNA fragment encoding the N46 amino acid sequence. All primers and the DNA fragment encoding the Fd sequence were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa). The N46 DNA fragment was then linked with Fd DNA fragment using an overlapping primer design program. The N46Fd DNA fragment was applied as the template for PCR amplification using the forward primer 5&#x2032;-CCGGAATTCGACGCTGACGGTACAGG-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO:33) and the reverse primer 5&#x2032;-GGAAGATCTTCAGTGGTGGTGGTG GTGGTGCAGAAAGGTAGA-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO:34). The amplified N46Fd DNA fragment was digested by EcoRI and BgIII and inserted into the vector pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2, designated pFUSE-N46Fd and encoded the N46Fd fusion protein. Subsequently, the pFUSE-N46FdFc plasmid DNA encoding the N46FdhFc protein was constructed using the same method of preparation for pFUSE-N46Fd with the following exceptions: (i) the pFUSE-N46Fd instead of the pHXB2-N46Fd plasmid was used as the template, and (ii) the following reverse primer was used: 5&#x2032;-GGAAGATCTCAGAAAGGTAGACAG-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO:35; containing no stop codon). The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the maps of the plasmids encoding N46Fd (A) and N46FdhFc (B). &#x201c;6H&#x201d; and &#x201c;TGA*&#x201d; represent 6-His tag and stop codon, respectively.</p>

<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Expression of N46Fd and N46FdhFc in Mammalian Cells and <i>E. Coli </i></heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The plasmids of pFUSE-N46Fd and pFUSE-N46FdhFc were transformed into DH5&#x3b1; cells. A single colony from freshly streaked selective plate containing 25 &#x3bc;g/ml Zeocin was picked and inoculated in a starter culture of 5 ml LB medium containing 25 &#x3bc;g/ml Zeocin with shaking at 250 rpm for 8 hrs at 37&#xb0; C. Then 2 ml of the starter culture supernatants was applied to 400 ml LB containing 25 &#x3bc;g/ml Zeocin. After incubation overnight at 37&#xb0; C., the broth was centrifuged at 6,000 rpm (4,500&#xd7;g) for 15 min. The plasmid was purified using a Plasmid Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, Calif.) and then transfected to 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fresh DMEM was supplied next day. N46Fd and N46FdhFc were purified as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For expression of N46FdhFc in <i>E. coli</i>, the plasmids pGEX-N46Fd and pGEX-N46FdFc were transformed into Rosetta 2 (DE3) LysS complete cells, respectively, which were incubated in LB medium containing 100 &#x3bc;g/ml ampicillin at 37&#xb0; C. overnight. One colony was selected and transferred to 5 ml of LB medium. After incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 16 hrs, 2 ml culture supernatants were collected and transferred to 400 ml LB containing 100 &#x3bc;g/ml ampicillin and 0.5 mM IPTG to induce protein expression. After culture for 4 hrs, the pellets were collected after centrifugation at 6,000 rpm (4,500&#xd7;g) for 20 min, and then sonicated three times (10 min each time). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (20,000&#xd7;g) for 30 min and filtration with 0.45 &#x3bc;m membrane, the supernatants were passed through a GST-binding column and the GST-tag was removed by treatment with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare, N.J.). N46Fd was purified by using a Ni-NTA His-Bind Superflow column since the foldon fragment in N46Fd can bind with his-binding beads. N46FdhFc was further purified by loading the eluated fractions to Protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column (Amerhsam Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). After washing, N46FdhFc was eluted with glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.7) and neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9), which was replaced by PBS using 10 kd filter (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, Mass.) through centrifugation at 2,900 rpm (2,003&#xd7;g) for 3 times and 20 min for each time. The purified protein was stored at &#x2212;4&#xb0; C. until use.</p>

<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Characterization of N46, N46Fd and N46FdhFc</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The recombinant fusion proteins N46Fd and N46FdhFc as well as the synthetic peptide N46 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, acid native PAGE, and Western blot. Purified N46, N46Fd and N46FdhFc (boiled and unboiled) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10-20% Tris-Tricine Gradient Gels (Invitrogen). The peptide or proteins were also analyzed by acid native PAGE as described by Sackett et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 281(31):21755-62, 2006). Briefly, 10% polyacrylamide continuous native gels at pH 3.4 were prepared using 30 mM &#x3b2;-alanine and 42 mM formic acid and pre-run in the same buffer containing 100 &#x3bc;M TCEP as a reducing agent. Gel electrophoresis was performed with a constant voltage of 125 V at room temperature for 2 h. The gel was then stained with Coomassie blue and imaged with a Fluor Chem 8800 imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, Calif.). For western-blotting, the peptide or proteins within the gels after separation by SDS-PAGE or acid native PAGE were transferred onto a 0.45 &#x3bc;m-pore nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) at 100 V for 2 h and then 60 V for 1 h. The blotted membranes were rinsed with PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) three times for 5 min and then blocked in fresh PBST containing 5% non-fat dried milk at 4&#xb0; C. overnight. After several washes, the membranes were incubated in rabbit anti-N46 IgG (1 &#x3bc;g/ml). HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (for anti-N46) and the ECL substrate solution (Amersham) were added sequentially. The blots were then visualized with autoradiography films.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, without boiling, N46Fd was found in trimeric and monomeric forms, while N46FdhFc was found mainly in trimeric form under reducing condition because the Fd-stabilized trimer is resistant to reducing reagent. With boiling, N46Fd and N46FdhFc were mainly in monomeric and dimeric forms, respectively. N46 was in monomeric form under reducing condition with or without boiling. All the major bands reacted with polyclonal anti-N46 antibodies by Western blots (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). N46, N46Fd and N46FdhFc displayed no bands in native PAGE because they contain a net positive charge, while each of them showed a single band in acid native PAGE (stained with Coomassie blue) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). All three immunogens reacted with rabbit anti-N46 antibodies by Western blots (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). These results suggest that N46Fd and N46FdhFc are in trimeric or other oligomeric forms.</p>

The XTT assay was conducted as previously described in Jiang et al. (J. Exp. Med. 174, 1557-1563, 1991). Briefly, MT-2 cells were infected with HIV-1 IIIB strain at 100 TCID<sub>50 </sub>(50% tissue culture infective dose) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS in the presence or absence of an antibody or antiserum at a series of 2-fold dilution at 37&#xb0; C. overnight. The culture supernatants were then removed and fresh media were added. On day 6 post-infection, 50 &#x3bc;l of XTT solution (1 mg/ml) containing 0.02 &#x3bc;M of phenazine methosulphate (PMS) was added. After 4 hrs, absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured with an ELISA reader and the ND50 values were calculated as described above. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and Table 3, sera from mice immunized with N46 and N46Fd exhibited no detectable inhibitory activity, while sera from all the five mice vaccinated with N46FdhFc exhibited potent neutralizing activity.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">These antisera were further tested for their neutralizing activity against infection by HIV-1 Bal (subtype B, R5) and an enfuvirtide-resistant HIV-1 strain NL4-3V38A/N42T in CEMx174 5.25M7 cells using luciferase assay by using a luciferase assay. Briefly, 50 &#x3bc;l of an antibody or antiserum from immunized mice at a series of dilution was incubated with an equal volume of an HIV-1 isolate at 0.01 multiplicity of infection (MOI) at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 min, followed by addition of the mixture to 100 &#x3bc;l CEMx174 5.25M7 or TZM-bI cells (1&#xd7;10<sup>5</sup>/ml) that were pre-cultured in a 96-well plate at 37&#xb0; C. overnight. After further culture at 37&#xb0; C. for 3 days, the cells were harvested and lysed with 50 &#x3bc;l lysing reagent. The luciferase activity was analyzed using a luciferase kit (Promega Corp.) and a luminometer (Model: Ultra 386, Tecan) according to the manufacture's instruction. The ND50 value of an antiserum was calculated using the software CalcuSyn. Similarly, anti-N46FdhFc antisera exhibited potent neutralizing activity against these two HIV-1 strains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and Table 3).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The neutralizing activity of antibodies or antisera against primary HIV-1 isolates was determined as previously described in Jiang et al. (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 48, 4349-4359, 2004). Briefly, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the blood of healthy donors using a standard density gradient (Histopaque-1077, Sigma) centrifugation. After incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 2 h, the nonadherent cells were collected and resuspended at 5&#xd7;10<sup>5</sup>/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 5 &#x3bc;g of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)/ml, and 100 U of IL-2/ml, followed by incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 3 days. The PHA-stimulated cells were infected with the corresponding primary HIV-1 isolates at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in the absence or presence of an antibody at a series of dilutions. The supernatants were collected 7 days post infection and mixed with equal volumes of 5% Triton X-100 for the detection of the p24 protein using ELISA as described in Jiang et al. with modification. Briefly, the wells of polystyrene plates (Immulon 1B, Dynex Technology, Chantilly, Va.) were coated with mouse anti-p24 mAb 183-12H-5C (NIH ARRRP) at 5 &#x3bc;g/ml in 0.05 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4&#xb0; C. overnight, followed by washes with PBS-T buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20) and blocking with PBS containing 2% dry fat-free milk (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, Calif.). Triton X-100 virus lysates were then added and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 1 h. After extensive washes, human anti-p24 mAb (37G12, purchased from Polymun, Vienna, Austria), biotin labeled anti-human IgG1 (Santa Cruz Biotech., Santa Cruz, Calif.), SA-HRP and TMB were added sequentially. Reactions were terminated by addition of 1N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Absorbance at 450 nm was recorded in an ELISA reader (Ultra 384, Tecan). Recombinant protein p24 (US Biological, Swampscott, Mass.) was used for establishing a standard dose response curve. These antisera against N46FdhFc also significantly neutralized infection of PBMCs by primary HIV-1 isolates 94UG103 (A, X4R5) and 92US657 (B, R5). However, the antisera directed against N46 and N46Fd at 1:40 dilution had no significant neutralizing activity against any of the viruses tested (Table 3). These results suggest that N46FdhFc is able to elicit antibodies with broad neutralizing activities.</p>

<heading id="h-0020" level="1">Antibodies Induced by N46FdhFc Inhibited HIV-1-Mediated Cell-Cell Fusion</heading>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The HIV gp41 fusion intermediate (NHR-trimer) plays a critical role in the HIV-1 fusion process. Therefore, the antibodies induced against the gp41 NHR-trimer may have inhibitory activities on HIV-induced cell-cell fusion. The inhibitory activities of the antibodies or antisera on HIV-induced cell-cell fusion were determined using a dye transfer assay as described by Jiang et al. (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 48, 4349-4359, 2004). Briefly, H9/HIV-1<sub>IIIB </sub>cells were pre-labeled with a fluorescent dye, Calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and incubated with a testing antibody or antiserum at a series of dilution at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 min in a 96-well cell culture plate. Then the CD4+MT-2 cells were added to the H9/HIV-1IIIB cells at a ratio of 10:1, followed by incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 2 hrs. The fused and unfused calcein-labeled HIV-1-infected cells were counted under an inverted fluorescence microscope with an eyepiece micrometer disc. The percent inhibition of cell fusion by an antibody or antiserum and the EC50 values were calculated using the software CalcuSyn. Antisera from all the five mice immunized with N46FdhFc exhibited potent HIV-1 fusion inhibitory activity with average 1050 of 1:154 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), while the antisera from mice immunized with N46 and N46Fd exhibited no detectable inhibitory activity at 1:40.</p>
<heading id="h-0021" level="1">Example 7</heading>
<heading id="h-0022" level="1">Antibodies Induced by N46FdhFc Bound Preferably to the gp41 Pocket Region</heading>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">To determine the target site of the neutralizing antibodies elicited by the N46FdhFc, antibody titers in the anti-N46, anti-N46Fd and anti-N46FdhFc antisera was compared against a series of antigens, including N46, Fd, IQN17, and (ccIZN17)<sub>3</sub>. For assessing the titers of antibodies in mouse sera against the gp41 NHR-trimer, the wells of a 96-well polystyrene plate (Costar) were coated with N46, Fd, or NHR-trimer, e.g., IQN17, or (ccIZN17)<sub>3</sub>, at 10 &#x3bc;g/ml in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.8) at 4&#xb0; C. overnight, and blocked with 2% non-fat milk in PBS for 3 hrs at 37&#xb0; C. Mouse sera in a series of 2-fold dilution were added. The plate was washed with the washing buffer (PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20) for 6 times to remove any unbound antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) linked goat-anti-mouse IgG was added, followed by incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 min. The reaction was visualized by addition of the substrate 3,3&#x2032;,5,5&#x2032;-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and A450 was measured by using an ELISA reader (Tecan US).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in Table 4, anti-N46 sera exhibited much higher binding titers against the N46 peptide and lower antibody titers against IQN17 and (ccIZN17)<sub>3 </sub>than those directed against N46Fd and N46FdhFc. This suggests that anti-N46 antibodies mainly bind to linear epitopes in the NHR domain, while the antibodies to N46Fd and N46FdhFc preferably react with conformational epitopes in the NHR-trimers. Notably, antisera directed against N46FdhFc bound to IQN17 and (ccIZN17)<sub>3 </sub>much more strongly than the anti-N46Fd antisera. This indicates that N46FdhFc elicits high levels of antibodies that may bind specifically to the pocket-forming sequence (N17), which overlaps the C-terminal fragment of N46 in the immunogen (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and that the neutralizing epitope(s) may be located in the pocket region. High titers of anti-Fd and anti-human IgG Fc antibodies were detected in the mouse antisera against N46FdhFc. However, the antisera from the mice immunized only with Fd or human IgG Fc had no virus neutralizing activity (data not shown), suggesting that the anti-Fd and anti-Fc antibodies in the anti-N46FdhFc sera are not responsible for the HIV-1 neutralization activity. Interestingly, the titer of antibodies to Fd in the anti-N46Fd sera (1:320,000) was much higher than that in the anti-N46FdhFc sera (1:12,126) (Table 4). This suggests that, although Fd in the fusion protein is highly immunogenic, the addition of the human IgG Fc to the C-terminus of N46Fd (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) might suppress the immunogenicity of Fd. This may be one of the reasons why N46FdhFc, but not N46Fd, elicits neutralizing antibody responses. Apparently, fusion of the Fc domain of human IgG to the C-terminus of N46Fd is critical for the design of N46FdhFc as an immunogen. Firstly, the Fc domain in N46FdhFc may suppress the immunogenicity of Fd, perhaps by covering Fd (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>) to prevent contact of Fd with antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and thus resulting in reduction of the immune interference of Fd with the immunogenicity of NHR-trimer. Secondly, the Fc domain in an immunogen may have an immunoenhancing effect because Fc-tagged protein can bind the Fc receptor (FcR) on dendritic cells or other APCs and thus promote internalization of the immunogen and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted antigen presentation. Thirdly, conjugation of a protein with Fc may prolong the half-life of the immunogen in immunized animals and thus enhance its immunogenicity.</p>

<heading id="h-0024" level="1">Antibodies Induced by N46FdhFc Blocked the gp41 Six-Helix Bundle Formation</heading>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">To investigate the mechanism by which anti-N46FdhFc antibodies neutralize HIV-1 infection and block HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion, the inhibitory activities of antibodies in the mouse anti-N46, anti-N46Fd and anti-N46FdhFc antisera were compared with normal mouse IgG as control. The inhibitory activity of antibodies on the 6-HB core formation between N46 (SEQ ID NO. 3) and biotinylated C34 (C34-biotin) was determined by an ELISA with a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) NC-1 (Jiang et al. J. Virol. 72, 10213-10217, 1998) and as previously described (He et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 105, 16332-16337, 2008). Briefly, an antibody at a series of dilutions was pre-incubated with equal amount of N46 at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 min, followed by addition of C34-biotin (0.5 &#x3bc;M). The mixture was added to the wells of a microplate coated with mAb NC-1 IgG (2 &#x3bc;g/ml in 0.1M Tris, pH 8.8) and blocked with 2% non-fat milk in PBS. The plate was then incubated for 30 min and washed with the washing buffer for 6 times to remove any unbound peptide. SA-HRP and TMB were added sequentially and A450 was measured. The percent inhibition of 6-HB formation and the IC<sub>50 </sub>values were calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, anti-N46FdhFc IgG effectively blocked the 6-HB core formation between N46 and C34 as determined by ELISA. However, normal mouse IgG and antibodies specific for N46 and N46Fd had no significant effect on the inhibition of gp41 6-HB core formation. These results suggest that N46FdhFc elicits antibodies that bind preferably to the viral gp41 pocket region and thus block the fusion-active 6-HB core formation between the viral gp41 NHR and CHR, and consequently result in the inhibition of HIV-1 fusion with the target cell and viral entry.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the field of immunogenic compositions for the prevention of HIV infection.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">More than 60 million people worldwide have been infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and nearly half have died of the resultant Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) since 1981. About 2.7 million new infections were reported in 2007. Therefore, development of an effective and safe HIV vaccine is urgently needed to contain the spread of HIV and AIDS. However, most previous efforts to achieve this goal have failed. Clinical trials of the first T-cell vaccine (Merck's MRKAd5 HIV-1 gag/pol/nef trivalent vaccine) were terminated recently because the data showed that the vaccine was unable to prevent HIV infection and could not lower virus levels in vaccinated volunteers who became infected. The first B-cell vaccine (VaxGen's AIDSVax, a bivalent gp120-based subunit vaccine) tested in clinical trials also failed to protect volunteers from HIV infection, possibly due to its inability to elicit broad neutralizing antibody responses because of great variability and high glycosylation of gp120. Since the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) transmembrane subunit gp41 has relatively conserved sequence and less glycosylation sites than gp120, it may be a better target than gp120 for vaccine development. Indeed, two human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting gp41, 2F5 and 4E10, exhibit much broader neutralizing activity than those targeting gp120 (mAbs 2G12 and b12).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">HIV-1 gp41 (SEQ ID NO. 2) plays an essential role in virus fusion with the target cell. HIV-1 pg41 consists of three essential functional regions: fusion peptide (FP), N-terminal heptad repeat (called NHR or HR1, which refer to the same sequence and are considered equivalent as used herein) and C-terminal heptad repeat (called CHR or HR2, which refer to the same sequence and are considered equivalent as used herein) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). Both NHR and CHR contain a number of leucine zipper-like motifs which have tendency to form coiled coil structures. Peptides derived from the NHR and CHR regions are effective in inhibiting HIV-1 fusion with the target cells and one of the CHR-peptides, enfuvirtide was licensed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2003 as the first member of a new class of anti-HIV drugs-HIV fusion inhibitors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">HIV fusion with the host cell is initiated by binding of Env surface subunit 120 to the primary receptor CD4 and a co-receptor, CXCR4 or CCR5, resulting in a series of conformational changes in gp41, including insertion of FP into the target cell membrane and association of CHR-helices with the NHR-trimer, a prehairpin intermediate, to form a stable six-helix bundle (6-HB) core, which bring the viral envelope and target cell membrane into close proximity for fusion. X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that 6-HB consists of three molecules of a NHR-peptide that form the inner trimeric coiled-coil and three copies of a CHR-peptide that pack obliquely in an anti-parallel configuration into the highly conserved hydrophobic grooves on the surface of the internal NHR-trimer. Each groove has a deep hydrophobic pocket (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, circled at bottom), which plays an important role in viral fusion and maintaining the stability of the 6-HB. Accordingly, it is proposed that a CHR-peptide (e.g., enfuvirtide or C34) inhibits HIV-1 fusion by binding to the viral gp41 NHR-trimer at the fusion-intermediate state to block the formation of fusion-active core of gp41. Therefore, the gp41 NHR-trimer is a crucial target for HIV therapeutics, and may also serve as an important target for HIV vaccines.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the gp41 NHR-peptides cannot form stable and soluble trimers in vitro spontaneously because these peptides have tendency to aggregate in physiological solutions. To study the structure, function and immunogenicity of the gp41 prehairpin intermediate, several soluble and stable NHR-trimer mimetics have been created, including IQN17 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>), in which a 17-mer NHR-peptide (aa 565-581) involving in formation of the gp41 hydrophobic pocket is linked with GCN4-pI<sub>Q</sub>I (IQ) motif, a soluble trimeric coiled coil, and similar mimetics with higher stability, including IZN17, IZN36 and (ccIZN17)<sub>3</sub>, in which IQ is replaced with more stable trimerization motif, IZ. Other examples of NHR-trimer mimetics include NCCG-gp41, N35<sub>CCG</sub>-N13, and 5-Helix in which one CHR peptide of the 6-HB is missing so as to expose the groove of the NHR-trimer. Although all these NHR-trimer mimetics properly present the hydrophobic groove and pocket and are effective in interacting with viral gp41 CHR to inhibit HIV-1 fusion, none of them could induce detectable neutralizing antibody responses in immunized animals. It is believed that the accessibility of the prehairpin intermediate of gp41 to antibody molecules (e.g., IgG) is limited because antisera directed against NHR-peptides exhibited no neutralizing activity at 37&#xb0; C., but were effective under suboptimal temperature (31.5&#xb0; C.) to prolong fusion intermediates. But interestingly, IgG1 m44, a human mAb directed against gp41 is much more potent than Fab m44 in neutralizing infection by primary HIV-1 isolates. Another human mAb, D5, that specifically binds to the pocket of NHR-trimer is highly potent to neutralize HIV-1 infection. Although rabbit antisera induced against N35<sub>CCG</sub>-N13 showed no neutralizing activity, purified IgG from the antisera (about 5-10% of total IgGs) with high-binding affinity to the NHR-trimer could significantly inhibit HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion. These data suggest that the gp41 NHR-trimer in the prehairpin fusion intermediate state is accessible to antibodies, which is not restricted by either antibody size or the presence of a kinetic barrier, but may be limited by the affinity of antibodies to bind with the NHR-trimer. Therefore, it is essential to design an immunogen with proper conformation and increased immunogenicity that can induce antibodies with high-binding affinity to the gp41 prehairpin intermediate.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR or HR1) alpha-helical trimer of HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) transmembrane subunit gp41 plays a crucial role in virus fusion with the target cell and represents an important target for therapeutics (e.g., enfuvirtide) and vaccines. Disclosed herein is a subunit immunogenic composition comprising a fusion protein comprising at least a portion of the HIV-1 gp41, a trimerization motif and an immunoenhancer. The immunogenic compositions disclosed herein may be administered in any formulations and with any adjuvant.</p>

The N46 peptide and the recombinant protein without Fc, N46Fd (SEQ ID NO. 24) were used as controls. Unlike the N46 peptide and N46Fd, N46FdhFc elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses in the immunized mice against infection by laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 strains.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another embodiment, a fusion protein is provided comprising a gp41 NHR sequence derived from one of the following sequences: HIV-1 94UG103, subtype A (SEQ ID NO. 4); 92US657, subtype B (SEQ ID NO. 5); HIV-1 93IN101, subtype C (SEQ ID NO. 6); HIV-1 92UG001, subtype D (SEQ ID NO. 7); HIV-1 92THA009, subtype NE (SEQ ID NO. 8); HIV-1 93BR020, subtype F (SEQ ID NO. 9); HIV-1 RU570, subtype G (SEQ ID NO. 10); HIV-1 BCF02, group O (SEQ ID NO. 11); or from HIV-2 CBL20 (SEQ ID NO. 12), a trimerization motif and an immunoenhancer.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The fusion protein described herein comprises at least one gp41 NHR sequence derived from the entire NHR(HR1) region or from part of the NHR(HR1) region, e.g., N17 (SEQ ID NO. 13), N36 (SEQ ID NO. 14), N28 (SEQ ID NO. 15), N36 (SEQ ID NO. 16), N51 (SEQ ID NO. 17), or N63 (SEQ ID NO. 18) derived from HIV-1 HXB2 (subtype B).</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the fusion protein described herein comprises an entire gp41 sequence from HIV-1 HXB2 (SEQ ID NO. 2). In another embodiment, the fusion protein comprises an entire gp41 sequence from HIV-1, HIV-2 or SIV.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Moreover, fusion proteins disclosed herein comprise a trimerization or oligomerization motif that includes, but is not limited to, foldon (SEQ ID NO. 18), IQ (the IQ calmodulin-binding motif, SEQ ID NO. 19), and IZ (isoleucine zipper motif, SEQ ID NO. 20), Foldon is a trimerization or oligomerization motif from the T4 bacteriophage fibritin.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Additionally, the fusion proteins include an immunoenhancer that includes, but is not limited to, Fc fragment of human IgG (SEQ ID NO. 20), mouse IgG Fc (SEQ ID NO. 21), rabbit IgG Fc (SEQ ID NO. 22), C3d of human complement, or an immunomodulator, such as a cytokine.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the immunoenhancer is immunoglobulin Fc fragment. The immunoglobulin molecule consists of two light chains and two heavy chains held together by disulfide bonds such that the chains form a Y shape. The base of the Y (carboxy terminus of the heavy chain) plays a role in modulating immune cell activity. This region is called the Fc (fragment, crystallizable) region, and is composed of two heavy chains that contribute two or three constant domains depending on the class of the antibody. By binding to specific proteins, the Fc region ensures that each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for a given antigen. The Fc region also binds to various cell receptors, such as Fc receptors, and other immune molecules, such as complement proteins. By doing this, it mediates different physiological effects including opsonization, cell lysis, and degranulation of mast cells, basophils and eosinophils.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As used herein, nucleotide sequences which are substantially the same share at least about 90% identity, and amino acid sequences which are substantially the same typically share more than 95% amino acid identity. It is recognized, however, that proteins (and DNA or mRNA encoding such proteins) containing less than the above-described level of homology arising as splice variants or that are modified by conservative amino acid substitutions (or substitution of degenerate codons) are contemplated to be within the scope of the present disclosure. As readily recognized by those of skill in the art, various ways have been devised to align sequences for comparison, e.g., Blosum 62 scoring matrix, as described by Henikoff and Henikoff in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915 (1992). Algorithms conveniently employed for this purpose are widely available (see, for example, Needleman and Wunsch in J. Mol. Bio. 48:443 (1970).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Therefore, disclosed herein are amino acid sequences 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to SEQ ID NOs:1-32.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Also disclosed herein are conservative amino acid substitutions of amino acids sequences SEQ ID NOs:1-32. Conservative amino acids substitutions are defined as changed, which although they alter the primary sequence of the protein or peptide, do not normally alter its function. Conservative amino acid substitutions typically include substitutions within the following groups: glycine and alanine; valine, isoleucine, and leucine; aspartic acid and glutamic acid; asparagine and glutamine; serine and threonine; lysine and arginine; and phenylalanine and tyrosine.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, the claimed fusion proteins can be constructed using overlapping primers. In another embodiment, the DNA sequence (GGCTATATTCCG GAAGCGCCGCGTGATGGCCAGGCGTATGTGCGTAAAGATGGCGAATGGGTGCTG CTGTCTACCTTTCTG; SEQ ID NO:36) encoding Fd (aa sequence: GYIPEAPRDG QAYVRKDGEWVLLSTFL) is synthesized first. Separate PCR products of the gp41 sequence and Fd are generated and the gp41 segment-Fd fusion fragment is amplified by one-round PCR using a gp41 forward primer and Fd reverse primer with gp41 (or a fragment thereof) and Fd DNA (PCR products) as templates. The amplified gp41 segment-Fd PCR product is then inserted into the hFc vector, to get an gp41-Fd-hFc recombinant plasmid encoding gp41-Fd-hFc fusion proteins. For the purposes of this discussion, the term &#x201c;gp41&#x201d; or &#x201c;gp41 component&#x201d; refers to the full-length gp41 protein, or a fragment thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The gp41 component (gp41), trimerization or oligomerization motif component (TM) and the immunoenhancer component (1E) of the fusion proteins can be constructed in a variety of orientations including, but not limited to, gp41-TM-IE, gp41-IE-TM, IE-gp41-TM, TM-gp41-IE, etc. In one embodiment, the components are arranged gp41-TM-IE.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc (human Fc, hFc), pFUSE-mIgG2a-Fc2 (murine Fc, mFc), or pFUSE-rIgG2-Fc2 (rabbit Fc, rFc) vectors are used for construction of the disclosed fusion proteins. In another embodiment, the fusion proteins can be expressed from other mammalian cell expression vectors, including, but not limited to, pcDNA3.1, pcDNA6-His, PEE13.1, PEE1.41, pCMV-NEO-BAM, pSV2, and pCMV1,2,3,4,5,6. In another embodiment, the fusion proteins can be expressed from insect cell expression vectors including, but not limited to, pAcGP67, pFastBac Dual, and pMT/V5-His-TOPO. In yet another embodiment, the fusion proteins can be expressed from <i>E. coli </i>expression vectors including, but not limited to, pET, pET-SUMO, and pGEX vectors with GST.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The following expression systems are suitable for use in expressing the disclosed fusion proteins: mammalian cell expression systems such as, but not limited to, pcDNA expression system, and GS Gene expression system; insect cell expression systems such as, but not limited to, Bac-to-Bac expression system, baculovirus expression system and DES expression systems; and <i>E. coli </i>expression systems including, but not limited to, pET, pSUMO and GST expression systems.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Advantages of proteins expressed in mammalian cell expression systems include the follows. The mammalian cell expression system is a relatively mature eukaryotic system for expression of recombinant proteins. There is a far higher chance to get correctly folded soluble proteins with proper glycosylation, making the expressed protein maintain native conformation and keep sufficient bioactivity if necessary. This system can either transient or stable express recombinant antigens, and promote signal synthesis. Recombinant proteins expressed in this way may keep good antigenicity and immunogenicity. However, both insect and bacterial expression systems provide inexpensive and efficient expression of active proteins, particularly when glycosylation is not required for bioactivity.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The purification systems are dependent on whether a tag is linked or fused with the fusion proteins. When the fusion proteins are fused with IgG Fc vectors, Protein A or Protein G affinity chromatography is used for the purification. If the fusion proteins are fused with GST proteins, the GST columns will be used for the purification. If the fusion proteins link with 6&#xd7;His tag at the N- or C-terminal, the expressed proteins are be purified using His tag columns. If no tag is linked with recombinant proteins, the expressed proteins re be purified using Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or other chromatographies.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In certain embodiments, the immunogenic compositions further comprise an adjuvant. Adjuvants suitable for use in animals include, but are not limited to, Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvants, Sigma Adjuvant System (SAS), and Ribi adjuvants. Adjuvants suitable for use in humans include, but are not limited to, MF59 (an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant), aluminum hydroxide, -phosphate or -oxide, HAVLOGEN&#xae; (an acrylic acid polymer-based adjuvant, Intervet Inc., Millsboro, Del.), polyacrylic acids, oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion based on, for example a mineral oil, such as BAYOL&#x2122; or MARCOL&#x2122; (Esso Imperial Oil Limited, Canada), or a vegetable oil such as vitamin E acetate, saponins, and Onchocerca volvulus activation-associated protein-1 (ASP-1) (see US 20060039921, which is incorporated by reference herein for all it discloses regarding ASP-1 adjuvants). However, components with adjuvant activity are widely known and, generally, any adjuvant may be utilized that does not adversely interfere with the efficacy or safety of the vaccine and/or immunogenic composition.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Vaccine and immunogenic compositions according to the various embodiments disclosed herein can be prepared and/or marketed in the form of a liquid, frozen suspension or in a lyophilized form. Typically, vaccines and/or immunogenic compositions prepared according to the present disclosure contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent customarily used for such compositions.

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Construction of Plasmids Encoding N46Fd and N46FdhFc</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The N46 sequence was derived from the NHR region of HIV-1HXB2 gp41. The pHXB2-env plasmid was employed as a template to synthesize a DNA fragment encoding the N46 amino acid sequence. All primers and the DNA fragment encoding the Fd sequence were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa). The N46 DNA fragment was then linked with Fd DNA fragment using an overlapping primer design program. The N46Fd DNA fragment was applied as the template for PCR amplification using the forward primer 5&#x2032;-CCGGAATTCGACGCTGACGGTACAGG-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO:33) and the reverse primer 5&#x2032;-GGAAGATCTTCAGTGGTGGTGGTG GTGGTGCAGAAAGGTAGA-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO:34). The amplified N46Fd DNA fragment was digested by EcoRI and BgIII and inserted into the vector pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2, designated pFUSE-N46Fd and encoded the N46Fd fusion protein. Subsequently, the pFUSE-N46FdFc plasmid DNA encoding the N46FdhFc protein was constructed using the same method of preparation for pFUSE-N46Fd with the following exceptions: (i) the pFUSE-N46Fd instead of the pHXB2-N46Fd plasmid was used as the template, and (ii) the following reverse primer was used: 5&#x2032;-GGAAGATCTCAGAAAGGTAGACAG-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO:35; containing no stop codon). The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the maps of the plasmids encoding N46Fd (A) and N46FdhFc (B). &#x201c;6H&#x201d; and &#x201c;TGA*&#x201d; represent 6-His tag and stop codon, respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The plasmids of pFUSE-N46Fd and pFUSE-N46FdhFc were transformed into DH5&#x3b1; cells. A single colony from freshly streaked selective plate containing 25 &#x3bc;g/ml Zeocin was picked and inoculated in a starter culture of 5 ml LB medium containing 25 &#x3bc;g/ml Zeocin with shaking at 250 rpm for 8 hrs at 37&#xb0; C. Then 2 ml of the starter culture supernatants was applied to 400 ml LB containing 25 &#x3bc;g/ml Zeocin. After incubation overnight at 37&#xb0; C., the broth was centrifuged at 6,000 rpm (4,500&#xd7;g) for 15 min. The plasmid was purified using a Plasmid Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, Calif.) and then transfected to 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fresh DMEM was supplied next day. N46Fd and N46FdhFc were purified as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For expression of N46FdhFc in <i>E. coli</i>, the plasmids pGEX-N46Fd and pGEX-N46FdFc were transformed into Rosetta 2 (DE3) LysS complete cells, respectively, which were incubated in LB medium containing 100 &#x3bc;g/ml ampicillin at 37&#xb0; C. overnight. One colony was selected and transferred to 5 ml of LB medium. After incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 16 hrs, 2 ml culture supernatants were collected and transferred to 400 ml LB containing 100 &#x3bc;g/ml ampicillin and 0.5 mM IPTG to induce protein expression. After culture for 4 hrs, the pellets were collected after centrifugation at 6,000 rpm (4,500&#xd7;g) for 20 min, and then sonicated three times (10 min each time). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (20,000&#xd7;g) for 30 min and filtration with 0.45 &#x3bc;m membrane, the supernatants were passed through a GST-binding column and the GST-tag was removed by treatment with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare, N.J.). N46Fd was purified by using a Ni-NTA His-Bind Superflow column since the foldon fragment in N46Fd can bind with his-binding beads. N46FdhFc was further purified by loading the eluated fractions to Protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column (Amerhsam Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). After washing, N46FdhFc was eluted with glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.7) and neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9), which was replaced by PBS using 10 kd filter (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, Mass.) through centrifugation at 2,900 rpm (2,003&#xd7;g) for 3 times and 20 min for each time. The purified protein was stored at &#x2212;4&#xb0; C. until use.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The recombinant fusion proteins N46Fd and N46FdhFc as well as the synthetic peptide N46 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, acid native PAGE, and Western blot. Purified N46, N46Fd and N46FdhFc (boiled and unboiled) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10-20% Tris-Tricine Gradient Gels (Invitrogen). The peptide or proteins were also analyzed by acid native PAGE as described by Sackett et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 281(31):21755-62, 2006). Briefly, 10% polyacrylamide continuous native gels at pH 3.4 were prepared using 30 mM &#x3b2;-alanine and 42 mM formic acid and pre-run in the same buffer containing 100 &#x3bc;M TCEP as a reducing agent. Gel electrophoresis was performed with a constant voltage of 125 V at room temperature for 2 h. The gel was then stained with Coomassie blue and imaged with a Fluor Chem 8800 imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, Calif.). For western-blotting, the peptide or proteins within the gels after separation by SDS-PAGE or acid native PAGE were transferred onto a 0.45 &#x3bc;m-pore nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) at 100 V for 2 h and then 60 V for 1 h. The blotted membranes were rinsed with PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) three times for 5 min and then blocked in fresh PBST containing 5% non-fat dried milk at 4&#xb0; C. overnight. After several washes, the membranes were incubated in rabbit anti-N46 IgG (1 &#x3bc;g/ml). HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (for anti-N46) and the ECL substrate solution (Amersham) were added sequentially. The blots were then visualized with autoradiography films.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, without boiling, N46Fd was found in trimeric and monomeric forms, while N46FdhFc was found mainly in trimeric form under reducing condition because the Fd-stabilized trimer is resistant to reducing reagent. With boiling, N46Fd and N46FdhFc were mainly in monomeric and dimeric forms, respectively. N46 was in monomeric form under reducing condition with or without boiling. All the major bands reacted with polyclonal anti-N46 antibodies by Western blots (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). N46, N46Fd and N46FdhFc displayed no bands in native PAGE because they contain a net positive charge, while each of them showed a single band in acid native PAGE (stained with Coomassie blue) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). All three immunogens reacted with rabbit anti-N46 antibodies by Western blots (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). These results suggest that N46Fd and N46FdhFc are in trimeric or other oligomeric forms.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Balb/c mice were immunized with adjuvant and N46, N46Fd or N46FdhFc and individual mouse serum was collected seven days after the last boost and tested for neutralizing activity against HIV-1 IIIB infection by the XTT assay for measuring HIV-1-mediated CPE. The XTT assay was conducted as previously described in Jiang et al. (J. Exp. Med. 174, 1557-1563, 1991). Briefly, MT-2 cells were infected with HIV-1 IIIB strain at 100 TCID<sub>50 </sub>(50% tissue culture infective dose) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS in the presence or absence of an antibody or antiserum at a series of 2-fold dilution at 37&#xb0; C. overnight. The culture supernatants were then removed and fresh media were added. On day 6 post-infection, 50 &#x3bc;l of XTT solution (1 mg/ml) containing 0.02 &#x3bc;M of phenazine methosulphate (PMS) was added. After 4 hrs, absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured with an ELISA reader and the ND50 values were calculated as described above. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and Table 3, sera from mice immunized with N46 and N46Fd exhibited no detectable inhibitory activity, while sera from all the five mice vaccinated with N46FdhFc exhibited potent neutralizing activity.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">These antisera were further tested for their neutralizing activity against infection by HIV-1 Bal (subtype B, R5) and an enfuvirtide-resistant HIV-1 strain NL4-3V38A/N42T in CEMx174 5.25M7 cells using luciferase assay by using a luciferase assay. Briefly, 50 &#x3bc;l of an antibody or antiserum from immunized mice at a series of dilution was incubated with an equal volume of an HIV-1 isolate at 0.01 multiplicity of infection (MOI) at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 min, followed by addition of the mixture to 100 &#x3bc;l CEMx174 5.25M7 or TZM-bI cells (1&#xd7;10<sup>5</sup>/ml) that were pre-cultured in a 96-well plate at 37&#xb0; C. overnight. After further culture at 37&#xb0; C. for 3 days, the cells were harvested and lysed with 50 &#x3bc;l lysing reagent. The luciferase activity was analyzed using a luciferase kit (Promega Corp.) and a luminometer (Model: Ultra 386, Tecan) according to the manufacture's instruction. The ND50 value of an antiserum was calculated using the software CalcuSyn. Similarly, anti-N46FdhFc antisera exhibited potent neutralizing activity against these two HIV-1 strains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and Table 3).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The neutralizing activity of antibodies or antisera against primary HIV-1 isolates was determined as previously described in Jiang et al. (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 48, 4349-4359, 2004). Briefly, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the blood of healthy donors using a standard density gradient (Histopaque-1077, Sigma) centrifugation. After incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 2 h, the nonadherent cells were collected and resuspended at 5&#xd7;10<sup>5</sup>/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 5 &#x3bc;g of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)/ml, and 100 U of IL-2/ml, followed by incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 3 days. The PHA-stimulated cells were infected with the corresponding primary HIV-1 isolates at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in the absence or presence of an antibody at a series of dilutions. The supernatants were collected 7 days post infection and mixed with equal volumes of 5% Triton X-100 for the detection of the p24 protein using ELISA as described in Jiang et al. with modification. Briefly, the wells of polystyrene plates (Immulon 1B, Dynex Technology, Chantilly, Va.) were coated with mouse anti-p24 mAb 183-12H-5C (NIH ARRRP) at 5 &#x3bc;g/ml in 0.05 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4&#xb0; C. overnight, followed by washes with PBS-T buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20) and blocking with PBS containing 2% dry fat-free milk (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, Calif.). Triton X-100 virus lysates were then added and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 1 h. After extensive washes, human anti-p24 mAb (37G12, purchased from Polymun, Vienna, Austria), biotin labeled anti-human IgG1 (Santa Cruz Biotech., Santa Cruz, Calif.), SA-HRP and TMB were added sequentially. Reactions were terminated by addition of 1N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Absorbance at 450 nm was recorded in an ELISA reader (Ultra 384, Tecan). Recombinant protein p24 (US Biological, Swampscott, Mass.) was used for establishing a standard dose response curve. These antisera against N46FdhFc also significantly neutralized infection of PBMCs by primary HIV-1 isolates 94UG103 (A, X4R5) and 92US657 (B, R5). However, the antisera directed against N46 and N46Fd at 1:40 dilution had no significant neutralizing activity against any of the viruses tested (Table 3). These results suggest that N46FdhFc is able to elicit antibodies with broad neutralizing activities.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The HIV gp41 fusion intermediate (NHR-trimer) plays a critical role in the HIV-1 fusion process. Therefore, the antibodies induced against the gp41 NHR-trimer may have inhibitory activities on HIV-induced cell-cell fusion. The inhibitory activities of the antibodies or antisera on HIV-induced cell-cell fusion were determined using a dye transfer assay as described by Jiang et al. (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 48, 4349-4359, 2004). Briefly, H9/HIV-1<sub>IIIB </sub>cells were pre-labeled with a fluorescent dye, Calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and incubated with a testing antibody or antiserum at a series of dilution at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 min in a 96-well cell culture plate. Then the CD4+MT-2 cells were added to the H9/HIV-1IIIB cells at a ratio of 10:1, followed by incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 2 hrs. The fused and unfused calcein-labeled HIV-1-infected cells were counted under an inverted fluorescence microscope with an eyepiece micrometer disc. The percent inhibition of cell fusion by an antibody or antiserum and the EC50 values were calculated using the software CalcuSyn. Antisera from all the five mice immunized with N46FdhFc exhibited potent HIV-1 fusion inhibitory activity with average 1050 of 1:154 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), while the antisera from mice immunized with N46 and N46Fd exhibited no detectable inhibitory activity at 1:40.</p>

<heading id="h-0022" level="1">Antibodies Induced by N46FdhFc Bound Preferably to the gp41 Pocket Region</heading>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">To determine the target site of the neutralizing antibodies elicited by the N46FdhFc, antibody titers in the anti-N46, anti-N46Fd and anti-N46FdhFc antisera was compared against a series of antigens, including N46, Fd, IQN17, and (ccIZN17)<sub>3</sub>. For assessing the titers of antibodies in mouse sera against the gp41 NHR-trimer, the wells of a 96-well polystyrene plate (Costar) were coated with N46, Fd, or NHR-trimer, e.g., IQN17, or (ccIZN17)<sub>3</sub>, at 10 &#x3bc;g/ml in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.8) at 4&#xb0; C. overnight, and blocked with 2% non-fat milk in PBS for 3 hrs at 37&#xb0; C. Mouse sera in a series of 2-fold dilution were added. The plate was washed with the washing buffer (PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20) for 6 times to remove any unbound antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) linked goat-anti-mouse IgG was added, followed by incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 min. The reaction was visualized by addition of the substrate 3,3&#x2032;,5,5&#x2032;-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and A450 was measured by using an ELISA reader (Tecan US).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in Table 4, anti-N46 sera exhibited much higher binding titers against the N46 peptide and lower antibody titers against IQN17 and (ccIZN17)<sub>3 </sub>than those directed against N46Fd and N46FdhFc. This suggests that anti-N46 antibodies mainly bind to linear epitopes in the NHR domain, while the antibodies to N46Fd and N46FdhFc preferably react with conformational epitopes in the NHR-trimers. Notably, antisera directed against N46FdhFc bound to IQN17 and (ccIZN17)<sub>3 </sub>much more strongly than the anti-N46Fd antisera. This indicates that N46FdhFc elicits high levels of antibodies that may bind specifically to the pocket-forming sequence (N17), which overlaps the C-terminal fragment of N46 in the immunogen (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and that the neutralizing epitope(s) may be located in the pocket region. High titers of anti-Fd and anti-human IgG Fc antibodies were detected in the mouse antisera against N46FdhFc. However, the antisera from the mice immunized only with Fd or human IgG Fc had no virus neutralizing activity (data not shown), suggesting that the anti-Fd and anti-Fc antibodies in the anti-N46FdhFc sera are not responsible for the HIV-1 neutralization activity. Interestingly, the titer of antibodies to Fd in the anti-N46Fd sera (1:320,000) was much higher than that in the anti-N46FdhFc sera (1:12,126) (Table 4). This suggests that, although Fd in the fusion protein is highly immunogenic, the addition of the human IgG Fc to the C-terminus of N46Fd (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) might suppress the immunogenicity of Fd. This may be one of the reasons why N46FdhFc, but not N46Fd, elicits neutralizing antibody responses. Apparently, fusion of the Fc domain of human IgG to the C-terminus of N46Fd is critical for the design of N46FdhFc as an immunogen. Firstly, the Fc domain in N46FdhFc may suppress the immunogenicity of Fd, perhaps by covering Fd (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>) to prevent contact of Fd with antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and thus resulting in reduction of the immune interference of Fd with the immunogenicity of NHR-trimer. Secondly, the Fc domain in an immunogen may have an immunoenhancing effect because Fc-tagged protein can bind the Fc receptor (FcR) on dendritic cells or other APCs and thus promote internalization of the immunogen and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted antigen presentation. Thirdly, conjugation of a protein with Fc may prolong the half-life of the immunogen in immunized animals and thus enhance its immunogenicity.</p>

<heading id="h-0024" level="1">Antibodies Induced by N46FdhFc Blocked the gp41 Six-Helix Bundle Formation</heading>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">To investigate the mechanism by which anti-N46FdhFc antibodies neutralize HIV-1 infection and block HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion, the inhibitory activities of antibodies in the mouse anti-N46, anti-N46Fd and anti-N46FdhFc antisera were compared with normal mouse IgG as control. The inhibitory activity of antibodies on the 6-HB core formation between N46 (SEQ ID NO. 3) and biotinylated C34 (C34-biotin) was determined by an ELISA with a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) NC-1 (Jiang et al. J. Virol. 72, 10213-10217, 1998) and as previously described (He et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 105, 16332-16337, 2008). Briefly, an antibody at a series of dilutions was pre-incubated with equal amount of N46 at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 min, followed by addition of C34-biotin (0.5 &#x3bc;M). The mixture was added to the wells of a microplate coated with mAb NC-1 IgG (2 &#x3bc;g/ml in 0.1M Tris, pH 8.8) and blocked with 2% non-fat milk in PBS. The plate was then incubated for 30 min and washed with the washing buffer for 6 times to remove any unbound peptide. SA-HRP and TMB were added sequentially and A450 was measured. The percent inhibition of 6-HB formation and the IC<sub>50 </sub>values were calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, anti-N46FdhFc IgG effectively blocked the 6-HB core formation between N46 and C34 as determined by ELISA. However, normal mouse IgG and antibodies specific for N46 and N46Fd had no significant effect on the inhibition of gp41 6-HB core formation. These results suggest that N46FdhFc elicits antibodies that bind preferably to the viral gp41 pocket region and thus block the fusion-active 6-HB core formation between the viral gp41 NHR and CHR, and consequently result in the inhibition of HIV-1 fusion with the target cell and viral entry.</p>
